UID:http://linguistlist.org/issues/26/26-3690.html
DESCRIPTION:Applications are invited immediately for a short-term postdoct
 oral research post as a ‘cognacy specialist’ in Indo-European.  Applic
 ants should have completed\, or be close to completing\, a Ph.D. in the co
 mparative linguistics of Indo-European.  \n\nThe post is to be filled as s
 oon as possible from 1st September 2015\, and will run until the end of De
 cember 2015\, with the possibility of a further few months in the first ha
 lf of 2016.  Some presence in Jena will be required\, especially at first\
 , and again in the lead-up to a conference in late November 2015.  Otherwi
 se\, much of your work could be done remotely\, if necessary.  \n\nYou wil
 l join a one-year project to radically revise\, improve and expand the exi
 sting IELex (1) legacy database of Swadesh lists for Indo-European languag
 es\, as recently used by Chang et al. (2015) in Language and Bouckaert et 
 al. (2012) in Science\, for example.  The objective is to create IELex 2\,
  a new standard reference resource of cognacy in basic vocabulary\, for as
  complete as possible a range of Indo-European languages\, ancient and mod
 ern.  All existing IELex 1 languages will be thoroughly re-analysed\, and 
 new languages added\, by a team of 20-30 specialists in each of the branch
 es and main sub-branches of Indo-European.\n\nYou will complement their wo
 rk by completely revising the cognate sets across the entire Indo-European
  family\, for our 230 basic meanings.  For a better idea of your task\, ex
 plore the old IELex 1 database (http://ielex.mpi.nl) and consider how it s
 hould be improved.  Choose some Swadesh meanings\, and explore the ‘cogn
 ate classes’ for each. \n\nInitially you will help design an improved an
 d more detailed database structure\, and a new web interface for data entr
 y and editing.  New fields are to be added\, to refine how cognates are sp
 ecified and distinguished:  e.g. where lexemes share a root\, but differ i
 n other morphemes and derivational processes\, such as ablaut grade\, redu
 plication\, etc.  You will be in close contact with branch specialists\, t
 o clarify any questions from either side.\n\nThe ideal candidate will be e
 xperienced particularly in the lexicon and morphology\, and not over-speci
 alised in just a few branches of Indo-European.  Rather\, you should have 
 broad experience across as many branches as possible.  \n\nAbove all\, IEL
 ex 2 is to be simply a database\, school-neutral and theory-neutral.  You 
 must have an open\, balanced sense of the field\, *without* commitment to 
 any particular school\, tradition or hypothesis.  Cognacy judgements are n
 ot to be influenced by any prior assumptions on still disputed clades\, tr
 ee topologies or hypothesised external relationships.\n\nPay will depend o
 n the applicant’s experience.  Exact forms of contract are negotiable.  
 \n\nThe Max Planck Society is concerned to employ more disabled people\;  
 applications from disabled people are explicitly sought.  The Max Planck S
 ociety wishes to increase the proportion of women in areas in which they a
 re underrepresented\;  women are therefore explicitly encouraged to apply.
 \n\nPlease apply by email to Dr. Paul Heggarty (email below)\, with the fo
 llowing attachments:\n\n- Your curriculum vitae.\n- A description (max. 75
 0 words) of your research interests and experience as relevant to the expe
 rtise required.\n- An abstract (max. 750 words) of your Ph.D. topic\, and 
 any significant postdoctoral research since.\n- A list of your publication
 s\, or a link to a personal website that shows them.  \n- (optional) Up to
  two sample publications that help illustrate your suitability for this po
 st.\n- Names and contact details of two referees.

 gisches Hochschulgesetz - BbgHG)\, preconditions for the appointment as a 
 Junior Professor include a completed university education\, teaching skill
 s\, and a special qualification for academic work\, which is usually demon
 strated though an outstanding PhD thesis. International experience\, an ou
 tstanding publication record and a teaching record are advantageous. The t
 otal time for completion of the PhD and subsequent post-doc employment sho
 uld not have exceeded six years. \n\nAppointments are made according to §
 § 40 and 46 BbgHG. The appointment as a civil servant or a public employe

 n\nThe project aims at methodological triangulation of factors that contri
 bute to structural convergence in a small-scale area among (for the most p
 art) closely related varieties\, namely the Baltic-Slavic contact zone sit
 uated at the intersection of East Slavic and Baltic dialects (Lithuania\, 
 Belarus\, Latgalia/Latvia). In connection with this the project also pursu
 es the aim of profiling this small area by mapping it onto the background 
 of increasingly larger concentric areas. Among other issues\, we are inqui
 ring into the following type of questions: Which features can really claim
  to have arisen as exclusive innovations (or archaisms)? How are particula
 r features “inserted” into larger clines? How do different clines inte
 rsect in the chosen small area? How can features of different complexity b
 e weighed against each other as for their significance in constituting a 
 ‘contact superposition zone’? How can we account for less spectacular 
 features in order to profile the region on the background of larger clines
 ?\n\nIn parallel\, a corpus of dialectal speech for East Slavic and Baltic
  dialects involved in that area is being built up\, and it will be enhance
 d further.\n\nApplicants are required to have:\n\n- PhD in Slavic\, Baltic
  or General Linguistics (but with a research focus on Slavic and/or Baltic
 ).\n- Good knowledge of Russian and at least one of the Baltic languages (
 Latvian (Latgalian)\, Lithuanian)\; additional knowledge of Belarusian and
 /or Polish is a plus.\n- Fluent command of English (written and spoken).\n
 \nPreference will be given to candidates with the following skills:\n\n- E
 xperience in corpus linguistics (the project’s corpus is run on ELAN)\n-
  Experience with related computer tools\n- At least basic skills in statis

 real linguistics\, dialect geography and dialectometry\, language variatio

 us an effective means to cooperate in groups\, pursue complex ideas and de

 in ingenious ways. Understanding why the world's languages are designed so
  differently—and how our minds acquire and exploit them to achieve diffe

DESCRIPTION:The School of English and Languages is seeking to appoint a po
 st-doctoral Research Fellow for a three-year Arts and Humanities Research 
 Council funded project “Loss of Inflection” (Principal Investigator Ma
 tthew Baerman\, Co-Investigators Oliver Bond and Greville Corbett). The pr
 oject is a cross-linguistic historical and typological study of how inflec
 tional morphology can be lost over time\, oriented around five research qu
 estions: (1) Are some morphosyntactic features more likely to be lost than
  others? (2) Are some types of morphological marking more likely to be los
 t than others? (3) Does the complexity of an inflectional system affect it
 s stability? (4) What is the relationship between inflectional loss and sy
 ntactic change? (5) Is the ‘natural’ loss of inflection different from
  contact-induced change? The project activities will include the construct
 ion of a cross-linguistic database.\n\nThe successful candidate should hav
 e a background in historical or typological linguistics\; experience in da
 tabase design and construction would be a plus. Candidates must have the a
 bility to work independently while functioning as part of a research team.
  The position is available from 31 March 2016.\n\nInformation about the Su
 rrey Morphology Group and their current research projects is available at 
 http://www.smg.surrey.ac.uk/.\n\nApplications should be submitted using th

DESCRIPTION:XPrag.de is offering four 12-month fellowships starting betwee
 n October 2015 and April 2016.\n\nIn the priority program SPP 1727 "New Pr
 agmatic Theories based on Experimental evidence (XPrag.de)" funded by the 
 German Research Foundation (DFG) researchers from the fields of linguistic
 s\, psychology and neuroscience are collaborating in 16 individual scienti
 fic projects at eight different German institutions. \n\nExperimental Prag
 matics is a new interdisciplinary field of research which has emerged with
 in the last decade. It combines research in Gricean pragmatics with the fo
 rmal models of modern grammar and the powerful experimental methods of psy
 chology and neuroscience. As a result\, Experimental Pragmatics can theore
 tically state and then empirically test much more precise hypotheses than 
 research in pragmatics previously could. Experimental Pragmatics is thereb
 y expected to lead to a new theory of mechanisms involved in language unde
 rstanding. Four starting points make substantial progress in pragmatics po
 ssible\, namely Pragmatic Theory\, Formal Models\, Embodied Cognition and 
 Experimental Methods. Experimental Pragmatics fruitfully connects the four
  starting points\, and it already has shown its potential to go beyond the
 se starting points to establish new insights in all four areas. \n\nXPrag.
 de offers a Start-up Funding program to support outstanding recent Ph.D. g
 raduates for a time period of 12 months each. Each funded fellow will join
  an individual XPrag.de project to prepare her/his own research proposal f
 or the second funding period of XPrag.de (May 2017 - April 2020)\, which u
 sually is an application for the fellow's own funding. The research propos
 al is supposed to be submitted to the DFG by end of October 2016.\n\nThe a
 pplicant must choose a suitable post doctoral supervisor for the time of t
 he fellowship in advance.  Any PI of a current XPrag.de project in Germany
  is eligible to act as supervisor. Beyond the support by the supervisor on
  a regular basis successful candidates will be offered additional support 
 in the form of research training opportunities\, funds for pilot experimen
 ts\, workspace\, etc.  Fellows can also participate in the bottom-up progr
 ams of XPrag.de such as the workshop program as well as the mentoring prog
 ram and the emergency daycare program. Fellows will receive a grant of 140
 0 € per month.\n\nFor more information about XPrag.de\, an overview of p
 articipating projects and contact data of principal investigators visit ou
 r website: http://www.xprag.de.\n\nRequirements:\n\nApplicants must hold a
  Ph.D. degree by the start of the fellowship. \n \nPlease submit a 2-page 
 (maximum) outline of your project idea and lay out your career planning. A
 dditionally\, please provide your CV\, sample writings\, contact details o
 f two references\, and two letters: one letter of commitment of the potent
 ial hosting institution in which the host commits to provide adequate work
 space.\n\nIn a second letter the potential supervisor needs to affirm that
  s/he will act as supervisor and hold at least monthly meetings with the f
 ellow and that s/he will provide access to equipment and funding for neces
 sary pilot experiments. \nAll application documents must be submitted as a
  single pdf to xprag.de@gmail.com. The application deadline is June 20th\,
  2015 and applicants will be notified by July 15th\, 2015.\n\nProposals ar

 to their potential to be accepted by the DFG as XPrag.de project for the 2

DESCRIPTION:One Research Fellowship within Theoretical Linguistics is avai
 lable in the Department of Language and Linguistics at the University of T
 romsø - The Arctic University of Norway (UiT). The position is affiliated
  to the research group CASTL-FISH (Centre for the Advanced Study of Theore
 tical Linguistics – Formal Investigations into Structure and Hierarchy).
 \n\nApplication deadline: 28.5.2015\nRef. no: 2015/1830\n\nThe appointment
  is a fixed term position for a period of three years.\n\nCASTL-FISH is th
 e sub-group of CASTL (Centre for the Advanced Study of Theoretical Linguis
 tics) which works on the core theoretical areas that form the basis of the
  study of language in its pure form: syntax\, morphology\, phonology\, and
  semantics. The group's focus is on core scientific research with long-ter
 m impact. The group concentrates on hierarchical structure and formal comp
 lexity\, properties that from our perspective make language a distinctive 
 and important area of study. This idea unifies the research done within th
 e group in syntax\, semantics\, morphology and phonology. The group is als
 o interested in the architectural issues involving the interfaces among th
 ese different areas. For more information about the CASTL-FISH research gr
 oup please consult the following URL: http://castl.uit.no/index.php/syntax
 /castl-fish\n\nThe successful candidate should have a research project tha
 t explicitly investigates structural and hierarchical formal properties of
  language in accordance with the CASTL-FISH project focus. We particularly
  invite proposals which deal with the relationship of structure to linear 
 order (either word order or morpheme order)\, or the relationship of struc
 ture to meaning. We will especially welcome projects that connect to more 
 than one research group or project within the Department of Language and L
 inguistics. The purpose of the postdoctoral position is to boost the CASTL
 -FISH research area by contributing energy and new\, original ideas at the
  interfaces of syntax\, morphology\, phonology or semantics.\n\nThe positi
 on will be divided between 80 % research time on the candidate's primary r
 esearch project and 20 % support work on collaborative research projects w
 ithin CASTL and the Department of Language and Linguistics\, as appropriat
 e to the applicant's skill set.

DESCRIPTION:Job Summary\n\nThe Dept. of Literary and Linguistic Studies at
  the University of Padova\, Italy\, is offering a 24-month post-doc-level 
 research position to a highly motivated junior speech scientist interested
  in pursuing research on the interaction of speech and gestures in second-
 language communication.\n\nThe candidate will work\, as a member of the re
 search team\, in the project “Encoding meaning in a second language: the
  role of gestures and prosody”\, coordinated by Prof. M. G. Busà. The p
 roject is aimed at investigating (1) how L2 learners at different stages o
 f L2 acquisition use gestures\; (2) how learners’ use of gestures in the
  L2 is synchronized with their production of L2 prosody\; (3) how learners
 ’ use of gestures and prosody is perceived and interpreted in communicat
 ion with native and non-native speakers. The main languages of investigati
 on will be: English as L1 and L2\; Italian as L1 and L2. Other languages m
 ay be added for comparison.\n\nProfile\n\nThe profile of the ideal candida
 te for this project is that of an experimental phonetician with an interes
 t in non-verbal language. A knowledge of second language acquisition will 
 be a plus. A knowledge of the Italian language will be appreciated but not
  a strict requirement (but the candidate will have to learn about Italian 
 linguistics). The candidate will need to have theoretical and practical kn
 owledge of most\, if not all\, of the following:\n\n- Experimental procedu
 res in phonetics\;\n- Speech analysis software\;\n- Acoustic analysis of s
 egmental and suprasegmental speech data\;\n- Manipulation and resynthesis 
 of speech data for the creation of perceptual stimuli\;\n- Notations used 
 for the transcription of intonation and prosody\;\n- Theory and analysis o
 f gestures\;\n- Multi-layered annotation tools for the analysis of multi-t
 rack signals (e.g.\, Elan)\;\n- Methods and software for statistical analy
 ses (Systat\, R\, or similar). \n\nAs a member of the research team\, the 
 candidate will also have to collaborate with the team in advancing the sta
 tus of the research with original ideas and by helping in the organization
  of seminars\, scientific conferences\, as well as spreading the research 
 results by giving presentations at conferences and writing papers. The can
 didate will be encouraged to develop his or her own line of investigation 
 within the research project and actively lead this subproject.\n\nBenefits
  \n\nThe project spans over a wide research area\, including the acoustics
  of foreign accent\, analysis of gestures\, language acquisition\, and com
 munication in multilingual and multicultural contexts. The Language and Co
 mmunication Lab at the University of Padova gathers a research team that i
 s small\, but growing\, and leaves space for individuals’ initiatives. I

DESCRIPTION:The University of Leipzig\, Germany\, offers full funding for 
 one post-doctoral candidate in any area of syntax\, morphology and/or phon
 ology and their interfaces.  The post-doctoral research will be carried ou
 t as part of the graduate programme "Interaction of Grammatical Building B
 locks" (IGRA) at the University of Leipzig (http://www.uni-leipzig.de/~igr
 a)\, funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG\, German Research 
 Foundation). The position is funded for 2 years\, with social benefits (pa
 yscale: 1.0 TVL-E13).\n\nThe central research focus of IGRA is on the phon
 ology\, morphology\, and syntax of natural languages. Recent developments 
 in grammatical theory have accumulated an impressive body of knowledge abo
 ut the representations of linguistic expressions of varying complexity\, a
 nd about the grammatical building blocks (rules\, operations\, constraints
 \, schemata\, extralinguistic factors) that restrict their distributions. 
 In addition\, there are some plausible hypotheses as to how these building
  blocks interact with one another. However\, what is so far lacking is a c
 omprehensive and systematic investigation of the possible interactions of 
 grammatical building blocks from different theoretical perspectives\, on t
 he basis of detailed empirical studies of phonological\, morphological\, a
 nd syntactic phenomena from an array of typologically diverse languages. I
 t is the primary goal of the graduate programme to address this gap.\n\nTh
 e post-doctoral candidates are encouraged to pursue research that is based
  on different grammatical models (and potentially also on combinations the
 reof)\, such as Minimalism\, Optimality Theory\, Rule-Based phonology\, Di
 stributed Morphology\, Lexical Decomposition Grammar\, Construction Gramma
 r\, Framework-Free Grammatical Theory\, Minimalist Morphology\, Paradigm-F
 unction Morphology. The programme will provide a unique opportunity of con
 ducting linguistic research in an academically rigorous environment that i
 s not pre-biased toward one or other theoretical framework. Detailed infor
 mation about the research programme\, including a list of the programme's 
 faculty and a list of potential dissertation topics\, can be found here: h
 ttp://www.uni-leipzig.de/~igra.\n\nApplication Requirements: Ideal candida
 tes are characterized by a proven research record in grammatical theory\, 
 peer-reviewed publications\, and international visibility. Researchers fro
 m international backgrounds are particularly encouraged to apply. Prior kn
 owledge of German is not required. Applicants should have a PhD in linguis
 tics\, with degree in hand latest by September 15\, 2015. The position sta
 rts on September 15\, 2015.\n\nSupporting documents: \n\n- Statement of pu
 rpose (up to 2 pages) that clarifies the research interests of the applica
 nt and details the nature of the project the candidate intends to pursue w
 ithin the post-doctoral position\, with particular focus on how this will 
 fit in with the larger research goals of the IGRA research programme: writ
 ten in English or German. \n- Two representative samples of research work:
  in English or German.  \n- Two letters of recommendation \n- Curriculum V

 publications in top-ranked international peer-reviewed journals\;\n– For
  senior applicants\, a strong teaching record at the advanced undergraduat
 e (corresponding to beginning ENS students) and graduate level\;\n– An a

 associated MA programs\;\n– An ability to take an active part in the org

 e cognitive sciences (including philosophy of language/mind).\n\nDesired s
 pecializations are likely to include formal theoretical linguistics and/or

DESCRIPTION:The research group in forensic speech science has been awarded
  a major research grant by the UK Arts and Humanities Research Council (AH
 RC)\, entitled Voice and Identity – Source\, Filter\, Biometric. The pro
 ject will run for three years\, from 1 February 2015 to 31 January 2018. T
 he project team is led by Professor Paul Foulkes and Professor Peter Frenc
 h\, with Dr. Philip Harrison as Research Fellow and Mr. Vincent Hughes as 
 Research Assistant (RA).\n\nThe project has two aims:\n\n1. To develop a m
 odel of individual speaker characterisation incorporating the three elemen
 ts of the speech/voice ‘triangle’ – namely the relationships between
  (a) the biological bases of speech/voice production\, (b) the auditory pe
 rceptions generated by different organic dimensions\, configurations and m
 ovements\, and (c) the associated measurable acoustic correlates. As well 
 as contributing to the subject knowledge of speech science generally\, the
  development of this model will enable us to form a causal understanding o
 f the strengths and limitations of the speaker comparison methods tested e
 mpirically under 2.\n\n2. To compare the performance of different methods 
 for forensic speaker comparison – from linguistics and phonetics\, acous
 tics\, and automatic speaker recognition (ASR) – on the same set of reco
 rdings. We will explore the performance of the methods to assess their rel
 ative strengths\, the consistency of their results and error patterns\, an
 d thus the potential for different methods to be integrated into a single 
 framework. The ultimate goal is to improve methods in forensic voice compa
 rison\, taking a major step towards the development of a methodology that 
 is more transparent\, validated\, and replicable. This outcome will benefi
 t academics and forensic practitioners\, the public\, judicial systems\, a
 nd investigative/security agencies.\n\nA second Research Assistant is soug
 ht to complete the team. The role of the RA is to assist with data analysi
 s\, and the preparation of conference presentations and publications. Empi
 rical work will consist of a range of analysis types\, including ASR and a
 coustic phonetic analysis using programs such as Praat. Ideally\, the RA w
 ill have knowledge and skills and to complement those of other members of 
 the team. Knowledge of relevant areas of human anatomy/physiology (vocal t
 ract and larynx) and skills in\, or familiarity with\, ultrasound or other
  methods of tissue imaging would be particularly welcome. The specific tas
 ks to be undertaken by the appointee will be negotiated within the team.

  data (maps\, search\, contacts) by talking to their cell phones.  Of the 
 6700 languages spoken in the world\, speech input is available in 40.  Why
  so few?  The problem is data.  Before it can be used\, speech input softw
 are must learn a language by studying hundreds of hours of transcribed aud
 io.  In most languages\, finding somebody who can transcribe hundreds of h
 ours of audio (somebody who is computer literate\, yet has time available 
 to perform this task) is nearly impossible.  Faced with this problem\, we 
 proposed a radical solution: solicit transcription from people who don't s
 peak the language.  Non-native listeners make many mistakes.  By building 
 a probabilistic model of their mistakes\, we are able to infer correct tra
 nscriptions\, and thus to train speech technology in any language.\n\nWe a
 re seeking a post-doctoral researcher who can scale these algorithms to co
 mmercial relevance.  Necessary qualifications include a Ph.D. in speech te
 chnology\, natural language processing\, computational linguistics and pho
 netics\, information theory or machine learning.  Objectives of the resear
 ch include the derivation\, implementation\, testing\, and publication of 
 new algorithms that train state of the art speech input technologies from 
 probabilistic transcription in the under-resourced languages of southeast 
 Asia.\n\nThis is a 20-month post-doctoral research position at the Advance

 Language (CoEDL http://dynamicsoflanguage.edu.au)\, is launching an ambiti
 ous series of interlinked projects\, focusing on language as a dynamic and
  variable system\, and drawing on the full diversity of the world's langua
 ges\, through four programs focusing on the design space of language (Shap
 e)\, how it is learned (Learning) and processed (Processing)\, and how lin
 guistic structures evolve at various timescales (Evolution). Two 'threads'
  (Archiving\, and New Generation technologies) will enable the technologic
 al advances needed to drive forward the language sciences in the coming de
 cades. The Centre is strongly interdisciplinary and features researchers f
 rom linguistics\, psychology\, anthropology\, philosophy\, bioinformatics\
 , robotics and speech pathology. CoEDL is centred on four Australian Unive
 rsities (Australian National University\, University of Melbourne\, Univer
 sity of Western Sydney and University of Queensland)\, with 14 further par
 tner institutions around the world.  \n\nWe are now recruiting a substanti
 al number of three-year postdoctoral positions for the first phase of the 
 Centre's activities. Each of these positions is free to international comp

  how languages encode categories underlying social cognition\, from kinshi
 p to theory of mind to conversational management. Data on individual langu
 ages is being gathered by a team of researchers\; this position will be ta

DESCRIPTION:Salary: £30\,434 - £31\,342		\nContract type: Fixed-term\nHo
 urs of work: 1.0 FTE	\nBased at: Heslington West\, University of York	\n\n
 We are seeking to appoint two full-time research assistants to work on a n
 ew ESRC-funded project: ‘The use and utility of localised speech forms i
 n determining identity: forensic and sociophonetic perspectives’. The pr
 oject team comprises Dr Carmen Llamas\, Dr Dominic Watt and Professor Pete
 r French. The positions are available for a period of three years to comme
 nce on 4 January 2016.\n\nThe project has two main aims – one sociophone
 tic\, the other forensic. Sociophonetically\, through analysis of the prod
 uction and perception of various phonological forms in the Northeast of En
 gland\, it seeks to better understand how forms can become localised to pa
 rticular speech communities\, while others become supralocal\, but remain 
 markers of regional identity. To this end\, the project will investigate w
 hether working-class speakers who are routinely geographically mobile with
 in the region make greater use of supralocal forms than those who are econ
 omically marginal and geographically immobile. If the immobility of the la
 tter gives rise to relative lack of contact between their proximal speech 
 communities\, geographically restricted phonological forms may develop and
  become markers of localised\, as opposed to regional identities. \n\nThe 
 forensic aim involves analysing the speech corpora collected from the Nort
 heast using long-term acoustic measures and comparing the ranges of variat
 ion found with those established from a corpus of Standard Southern Britis
 h English.  This will throw light on the extent to which accent difference
 s have a bearing on the performance of automatic speaker recognition syste
 ms\, relative to the effects of vocal tract-related (i.e. anatomical) fact
 ors. \n\nThe posts are suitable for post-doctoral candidates who have rese
 arch interests and expertise in areas of quantitative sociophonetics\, par
 ticularly phonetic/phonological variation and change\, and forensic phonet
 ics\, particularly with regard to the use of Bayesian likelihood ratios. S
 uccessful candidates will have a high level of competence in auditory- and
  acoustic-phonetic analysis. Experience of fieldwork and/or the design of 
 perceptual experiments would also be advantageous. \n\nMain purpose of the
  role\n\n- To conduct research under the supervision of senior colleagues 
 and to contribute to the production of research\n- To assist in the identi
 fication and development of potential areas of research and the developmen
 t of proposals for independent or collaborative research projects\n\nKey r
 esponsibilities \n(Role holders will be required to undertake some or all 
 of the duties below)\n\n- To conduct individual and collaborative research
  projects\, duties to include: analysis and interpretation of research dat
 a\; use of appropriate research techniques and methods\; writing up of res
 earch results and dissemination through publications\,  seminar and confer
 ence presentations and public engagement and outreach activities\; contrib
 uting to the identification of possible new areas of research\n- To contri
 bute to the preparation of research proposals and applications to external
  bodies\n- To undertake appropriate organisational and administrative acti
 vities connected to the research project\, including conference organisati

 website maintenance and development\n- To assist with undergraduate teachi

DESCRIPTION:The successful candidate will be the leader of the lab and be 
 responsible for the equipment\, for hiring and training lab assistants\, f
 or the stored data\, for the lab outreach work\, and for corpus collection
  and experimental work\, including experimental design and statistical ana
 lysis. The position is affiliated with the LAVA research group (Language A
 cquisition\, Variation & Attrition)\, and the successful candidate will be
  carrying out research that will strengthen the research profile of the gr
 oup.\n\nFor a number of years\, the acquisition research group at CASTL/De
 partment of Language and Linguistics has worked on monolingual language ac
 quisition\, focusing on linguistic phenomena where there is variation in t
 he input\, e.g. word order variation expressing fine distinctions in synta
 x and information structure. In recent years\, there has been an increased
  focus on variation in a bilingual/multilingual perspective\, i.e. bilingu
 al acquisition (2L1)\, second and third language acquisition (L2 and L3)\,
  as well as heritage languages (e.g. Norwegian in the USA or Russian in No
 rway). Recent and current research projects in the LAVA group study langua
 ge combinations such as Norwegian-English\, Norwegian-Russian\, Norwegian-
 North Sami\, Ukrainian-English\, Latvian-Russian\, Spanish-English-Portugu
 ese\, as well as English as an L3 (in combination with Norwegian and a Sla
 vic language). There is also increasing interest in investigations of two 
 closely related varieties\, e.g. Brazilian-European Portuguese\, Norwegian
 -Swedish\, Spanish-Catalan\, or two Norwegian dialects. The advertised pos
 ition opens up for research projects on the same or other relevant languag
 e or dialect combinations.\n\nThe work of the LAVA group has a theoretical
  foundation and the focus is on the mental grammars of various populations
  of speakers. The object of study is syntactic microvariation and the impo
 rtance of factors such as complexity\, frequency or economy in the acquisi
 tion process and in heritage language situations. The research methodology
  includes both corpora of spontaneous production as well as different type
 s of experimental work (production experiments\, eyetracking). The success
 ful candidate for the advertised researcher position should spend 50% of t
 he work time on research that will strengthen and complement the research 
 profile of the LAVA group.\n\nThe working hours are divided between lab re
 sponsibilities and research. The research time includes research and resea
 rch-related activities as well as research administration.\n\nThe advertis
 ed position also includes duties in the language acquisition lab (50%). Th
 e successful candidate will be the leader of the lab and be responsible fo
 r the equipment\, for hiring and training lab assistants\, for the stored 
 data\, and for all activities of the lab\, including corpus collection and
  experimental work.\n\nQualification requirements\n\n- PhD within linguist
 ics or a related field relevant to the job description.\n- Experience with
  experimental work relevant to the LAVA group (production experiments\, ey
 etracking\, etc.)\, including experimental design.\n- Documented qualifica
 tions in and/or extensive experience with statistical analysis (preferably
  R).\n- A strong academic record and an active research program in a field
  relevant to the LAVA group.\n- Proficiency in Norwegian or another Nordic
  language will be considered an advantage\, given that much of the data co
 llected in the lab will be in Norwegian.\n- Outreach experience\, includin

 nd represents the extracted knowledge as formal knowledge graphs that are 
 linked to existing datasets\, hence generating an abstractive variety of m

 d evaluate it in a use case for context-sensitive SWMR.\n\nJob description
 :\n\nThe postdoctoral research will concentrate on:\n\n- Investigating how
  formal and statistical (e.g. deep learning) methods can be hybridized for
  extending SWMR\n- Implementing the method by evolving the current SWMR pi

 L/Department of Language and Linguistics has worked on monolingual languag
 e acquisition\, focusing on linguistic phenomena where there is variation 
 in the input\, e.g. word order variation expressing fine distinctions in s

 ingual acquisition (2L1)\, second and third language acquisition (L2 and L
 3)\, as well as heritage languages (e.g. Norwegian in the USA or Russian i

 lication.\n\nWe currently do not sponsor visa applications\, so applicants
  must be fully authorised to work in the U.K. or in the U.S.\n\nWe expect 
 to have funding for this position available around the start of the next c
 alendar year. The starting salary will be modest\, but will increase over 
 time as the company grows. The stock options will be extremely generous\, 
 reflecting the fact that Chenope is an employee owned company. Basic benef

 \nDuties: The position regards research in the subject area of linguistics
  as well as limited (ca. 15%) teaching and thesis supervision at various c
 ycles. We seek an active researcher to develop an empirically oriented res
 earch programme in typology and language variation with the emphasis on ty
 pological change and its historical\, ecological\, social and psychologica

 stdoctoral research fellow if they have completed a doctoral degree or hav
 e attained the equivalent academic competence. Primary consideration shoul
 d be given to those who finished their doctorate no more than seven years 
 prior to the application deadline.\n\nUnder the Uppsala University Appoint

 emonstrating a scientific work mode in research on language variation and 
 language change. Equally great emphasis will attach to academic experience
  of quantitative methods in relevant subjects (e.g. in phylogeny\, geograp

  quality and feasibility of the research plan will be taken into considera
 tion.\n\nTeaching competence will also be assigned weight. Teaching compet
 ence regarding educational and teaching qualifications and\, primarily\, t

DESCRIPTION:Applications are invited immediately for up to three short-ter
 m posts (c. 4 months) in phonetic transcription\, as a postdoctoral resear
 cher at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History (http://
 www.shh.mpg.de/en) in Jena\, Germany\, in the Department of Linguistic and
  Cultural Evolution.  The posts are open to phoneticians who have complete
 d\, or are close to completing a Ph.D. in phonetics.  \n\nYour task will b
 e to transcribe samples of cognate words from either the Germanic family\,
  or the Quechua and Aymara families.  Please explore the provisional websi
 te http://www.soundcomparisons.com\, to which you will contribute.\n\nAppo
 intments are to start as soon as possible from 1st September 2015.  Posts 
 will run until the end of December 2015.  Some presence in Jena will be re
 quired\, especially at the start of the contract\, but much of the transcr
 iption work could also be done remotely.  \n\nCandidates must combine two 
 forms of expertise and experience:  (1) transcription at our target level 
 of relatively close phonetic transcription\;  but informed by (2) extensiv
 e knowledge of historical/comparative linguistics of sound change\, especi
 ally at the dialect and accent levels (regional\, rather than socio-lingui
 stic or idiolectal).  Ideally\, such experience will have been gained spec
 ifically with phonetic diversity across the Germanic or Andean languages.\
 n\nOne post is to transcribe recordings of dialects of the Quechua and Aym
 ara families in the Andes.  This is open widely to phoneticians irrespecti
 ve of their native language\, but especially valuable would be experience 
 with contrasts between plain\, aspirated and ejective stops\, and between 
 palatal\, velar and uvular obstruents.\n\nThe other post(s) concerns the G
 ermanic family\, and alongside transcription will also involve making new 
 recordings of further dialectal varieties.  There are two subsets of langu
 ages to cover:  the Scandinavian (‘North’) branch of Germanic\;  and t
 he continental West Germanic branch (excluding English).  Applications are
  invited to cover either or both of those sub-branches\, depending on your
  experience and specialisation.  Particularly suitable would be phoneticia
 ns who are native speakers of a North or Continental Germanic language.\n\
 nYour transcriptions will feed into a major new online database\, and rese
 arch to measure phonetic distances within language families.  Research out
 puts will include publication opportunities\, and credits on the project d
 atabase and website.  See also http://www.languagesandpeoples.com/Germanic
  and https://eva-mpg.academia.edu/PaulHeggarty/Linguistics:-Quantitative-&
 -Phylogenetics.  \n\nPay will depend on the applicant’s experience.  Exa
 ct forms of contract are negotiable.  \n\nThe Max Planck Society is concer
 ned to employ more disabled people\;  applications from disabled people ar
 e explicitly sought.  The Max Planck Society wishes to increase the propor
 tion of women in areas in which they are underrepresented\;  women are the
 refore explicitly encouraged to apply.\n\nPlease apply by email (in Englis
 h\, German\, Spanish\, Italian or French) to Dr Paul Heggarty (email below
 )\, with the following attachments:\n\n- Your curriculum vitae.\n- A descr
 iption (max. 750 words) of your research interests and experience as a pho
 netician and transcriber\, as relevant to the expertise required.\n- An ab
 stract (max. 750 words) of your Ph.D. topic.\n- A list of your publication
 s\, or a link to a personal website that shows them.  \n- You may also att
 ach up to two sample publications to help illustrate your suitability for 
 this post.\n- Names and contact details of two referees.
