DESCRIPTION:Workshop at the 38th Annual Conference of the German Linguisti
 cs Society (DGfS)\nOrganizers:\n\nAnton Benz\, Ralf Klabunde\, Sebastian R
 euße\, Jon Stevens\n\nInvited Speakers:\n\nKees van Deemter\, University 
 of Aberdeen\nt.b.a.\n\nComputational pragmatics can be understood in two d
 ifferent senses. First\, it can be seen as a subfield of computational lin
 guistics\, in which it has a longer tradition. Example phenomena addressed
  in this tradition are: computational models of implicature\, dialogue act
  planning\, discourse structuring\, coreference resolution (Bunt & Black 2
 000\, and others). Second\, it can refer to a rapidly growing field at the
  interface between linguistics\, cognitive science and artificial intellig
 ence. An example is the rational speech act model (Frank & Goodman 2012) w
 hich uses Bayesian methods for modeling cognitive aspects of the interpret
 ation of sentence fragments and implicatures. Computational pragmatics is 
 of growing interest to linguistic pragmatics\, first\, due to the availabi
 lity of theories that are precise enough to form the basis of NLP systems 
 (e.g. game theoretic pragmatics\, SDRT\, RST)\, and second\, due to the ad
 ditional opportunities which computational pragmatics provides for advance
 d experimental testing of pragmatic theories. As such\, it enhances theore
 tical\, experimental and corpus-based approaches to pragmatics.\n\nIn this
  workshop\, we want to bring together researchers from both branches of co
 mputational linguistics\, as well as linguists with an interest in formal 
 approaches to pragmatics. Topics of the workshop include\, but are not lim
 ited to\, the following issues: \n\n- Implicature calculation and its impl
 ementation in NLP systems: interaction with information structure\, discou
 rse relations\, dialogue goals etc.\n- Computational models of experimenta
 l results and computational systems as a means for experimental research \
 n- Corpus annotation of pragmatic phenomena\n\nWe welcome contributions by
  theoretical linguists\, computational linguists\, and corpus linguists wi
 th an interest in computational approaches to pragmatics and their empiric
 al underpinning. We solicit contributions for 30 (20+10) and 60 minute (45
 +15) presentations. In case of a 30 minute presentation\, authors should s
 ubmit an anonymous 2 page extended abstract. For 60 minute presentations\,
  authors should submit an anonymous 4 page paper (in both cases: A4\, font
  size: 12pt\, line spacing: 1.5). \n\nPlease send your abstract and paper 
 to: compprag2016@linguistics.rub.de. The subject of the message should be 
 ‘computational pragmatics 2016’\, and the body of the message should i
 nclude the name(s) of the author(s)\, affiliation(s)\, and contact informa
 tion (including email address). \n\nThe workshop language is English.\n\nW
 e are planning to publish selected contributions as a special issue of an 
 appropriate\, internationally renowned journal.\n\nImportant Dates:\n\nAbs

DESCRIPTION:We wanted to pass along some good news from LSA and NSF. The s
 pecial session that we proposed\, ''Preparing your Corpus for Archival Sto
 rage\,'' has been accepted as a Satellite Session for LSA 2016 held Januar
 y 7-10\, 2016 in Washington D.C. The session will take place on Thursday J
 anuary 7 before the start of the Annual LSA Meeting.\n  \nAs you all know\
 , NSF has emphasized that we should prepare our corpora for storage\, so t
 hat other researchers [or we ourselves\, at a later date] can use the olde
 r material for comparison with newer studies. This meeting will present th
 e critical factors that could not be included in an earlier NSF supported 
 workshop examining issues in preparing data for comparison and sharing. Be
 low you will see the line-up of scheduled presenters. There will be six or
 al presentations plus discussion among the presenters and with other works
 hop participants. NSF is funding the workshop so there will be no addition
 al registrations fees for those already taking part in the annual meeting.
  \n\nNote that any students who are about to carry out their own fieldwork
 \, or who have begun doing so are eligible to apply for funding to help de
 fray the extra costs of arriving early. There is an application form for t
 he scholarship. Students must emphasize and include documentation that the
 y have been or are about to carry out fieldwork.  In addition\, there will
  be [at least] two other symposia during LSA which will be relevant to thi
 s question but will not be in overlap in coverage.\n\nSession Abstract:\n\
 nAn NSF supported satellite workshop on Archival Preparation will be held 
 in conjunction with and immediately preceding the annual meeting of the Li
 nguistic Society of America (LSA) on January 7\, 2016. NSF policy now stip
 ulates that investigators are expected to make available to other research
 ers the primary data created or gathered under NSF grants. However\, the m
 etadata presently associated with archived data are often inadequate to pe
 rmit data\, (e.g. sound files)\, from related studies to be compared\; wit
 hout an agreed-upon coding protocol\, there can be no effective sharing an
 d comparison across speech corpora. Invited speakers will discuss specific
  coding conventions for such factors as socioeconomic and educational spea
 ker demographics\, and for language choice\, stance and footing. Using app
 ropriate metadata for these factors will facilitate sharing of corpora and
  research to determine how each factor impacts on language use.\n \nNSF pr
 eviously supported a workshop in which leading scholars discussed data pro
 tocols\, obtaining ethics board approval for human subject research\, and 
 ensuring that the information gathered about human subject demographics\, 
 attitudes and the situations in which they were recorded provide enough sc
 ope and detail to permit meaningful comparison across studies\, and thus e
 ncourage data sharing. Following that model\, this workshop will extend th
 e topics covered\, and provide a training forum in which to develop protoc
 ols for sharable data that conform to the spirit of NSF policy. This award
  will also support the participation of students in the training and discu
 ssions.\n\nWe are looking forward to seeing you all in Washington in Janua
 ry!\n\nBest wishes\,\n\nMalcah Yaeger [malcah@gmail.com]\nChris Cieri [cci

DESCRIPTION:The International Conference on Intercultural Pragmatics and C
 ommunication (INPRA) is a well known biennial meeting and this would be it
 s 7th edition. The main aim of the Conference is to bring together researc
 hers from around the world who have diverse scientific backgrounds but sha
 re the same field of interest – pragmatics\, being perceived as a cognit
 ive\, philosophical\, social\, and intercultural perspective on language a
 nd communication.\n\nNumerous renowned linguists and scholars will give sp
 eeches\, re-define key questions and present research findings. In particu
 lar\, the Scientific Committee strongly encourages younger scholars and Ph
 D students concerned with pragmatics to give speeches\, too.\n\nThis Confe
 rence should promote connections between pragmatic theory and its applicat
 ion in practice. The various subfields of pragmatics and different approac
 hes even to the same topic will provide a better understanding of intercul
 tural communication in today’s communication-driven society. \n\nParalle
 l sessions will be held in relation to the following non-exhaustive themat
 ic strands:\n\n1. Pragmatics theories and theoretical perspectives (philos
 ophical\, cognitive\, societal)\n\n-Classical pragmatics (speech-acts theo
 ry\, Grice and conversational implicatures)\n-Contemporary pragmatics theo
 ries (relevance theory\, socio-cognitive approach\, etc.)\n-Metapragmatics
 \n-Pragmatic meaning\, semantic-pragmatic interface\, content and context\
 n-Implicatures (neo-Gricean approaches)\; explicatures\n-Discourse deixis\
 n-Presuppositions \n-Speech acts: conventionality and intentionality\n-Dev
 elopmental experimental pragmatics \n-Formulaic language\, figurative lang
 uage\netc…\n\n2. Intercultural\, cross-cultural and societal aspects of 
 pragmatic research:\n\n-Communicating interculturality: speaking across cu
 ltures\n-Lingua franca pragmatics\n-Societal pragmatics\, pragmemes\n-Comm
 unication and cultural patterns\, intercultural misunderstandings\n-Sociop
 ragmatics: interlanguage\n-Language and social networks\n-Understanding ev
 eryday language (speakers’ repertoires)\n-(Im)politeness phenomena (inte
 ntion\, cultural models and context)\n-Cultural dimensions of discourse\n-
 Computer-mediated communication\, media communication\n-Gendered speech co
 mmunities\netc…\n\n3. Applications:\n\n-Raising pragmatic awareness\n-Pr
 agmatic competence\n-Teaching intercultural pragmatic competence\, teachab
 ility and learnability of pragmatic skills\n-Use of speech acts\n-Usage an
 d corpus-based approaches\n-Pragmatic skills and variations across languag
 es and cultures \netc…\n\nThe conference is open to all other pragmatics
 -related topics broadly defined.\n\nKeynote Speakers:\n\nWayne Davis (Geor

SUMMARY:Lexical Combinations and Typified Speech in a Multilingual Context
DTSTART;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20160211T000000
DTEND;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20160213T000000
UID:http://linguistlist.org/issues/26/26-4266.html
DESCRIPTION:While communicating in a certain language\, we do not only com
 pose single words into meaningful sentences and texts by applying grammati
 cal rules\, but we also use prefabricated word combinations that can be of
  a different kind and have higher or lower grades of fixity. This linguist
 ic fact has been studied particularly within phraseological research in wh
 ich\, besides idiomatic expressions\, also phraseologisms in a broader sen
 se of the term\, such as collocations and communicative phrasemes\, are ob
 jects of analyses. In recent years\, the perspective has become increasing
 ly broader\, not least due to progress in the fields of computational and 
 corpus linguistics\, as electronic corpora offer the chance of extracting 
 a much larger spectrum of recurrent and statistically significant lexical 
 combinations. Hence\, in addition to combinations connected to the languag
 e system and norm\, also prefabricated sequences as phenomena of the ‘sp
 eech’ have become a focus of phraseological analyses. In this regard\, a
 lso further concepts have been proposed\, like for example those of typisi
 erte Rede (‘typified speech’\; cf. e.g. Fernandez Bravo et al. [eds.] 
 1999) and of formulaic sequences (cf. Wray 2002).\n\nThe present conferenc
 e marks the end of a homonymous research project (short title: LeKo)\, fun
 ded by the Autonomous Province of Bolzano/Bozen-South Tyrol and carried ou
 t in cooperation between the University of Innsbruck (Department of Romanc
 e Languages) and the EURAC (Institute for Specialised Communication and Mu
 ltilingualism) (http://www.leko-project.org). In this project\, among othe
 rs\, a learner corpus of Italian as an L2 which was elaborated at EURAC ha
 s been analysed according to the use of units belonging to typified speech
 \, by evaluating the corpus data both qualitatively and quantitatively. Mo
 reover\, an attempt to detect possible causes for errors on the part of L2
  learners with German as a first language was conducted\, in addition to d
 iscovering specific South Tyrolean features of L2 language use and creatin
 g proposals for suitable didactic material. A multilingual context in LeKo
  is provided as South Tyrol distinguishes itself through strong multilingu
 alism\, which is present on the individual\, social and institutional leve
 l: there are three official languages\, Italian\, German and Ladin\, which
  are accompanied by several more minority languages.\n\nIn relation to the
  project core areas mentioned above\, several issues have arisen which sho
 uld be discussed during the conference and represent the starting points f
 or the pool of thematic fields listed below. The aim of the conference is 
 on one hand\, research exchange with and within researchers who work on co
 rrelated topics\, and on the other hand the presentation of the results of
  the project\, which should be discussed during the conference and expande
 d upon in the research discourse in addition to being made accessible to l
 anguage teachers and students.\n\nRegistration and Registration Fee:\n\nIn
  order to participate in this conference\, please send the completed form 
 (to be found at http://www.conference/leko/anmeldung/) to leko@uibk.ac.at 
 (in the event of advance payment by bank transfer\, please attach the rece

SUMMARY:Interculturality: Applied and Critical Perspectives

DESCRIPTION:Interculturality: Applied and Critical Perspectives - Internat
 ional Epic Conference\nOctober 16-17 2015 - KU Leuven\, Campus Antwerpen\n
 \nThe 2015 International Conference on Interculturality will be held in An
 twerp\, Belgium from 16-17 October 2015. Accepted and presented papers wil
 l be published in the EPIC 2015 Conference Proceedings. Contributions can 
 be made in French and English\, and will have to be presented within 20 mi
 nutes\, followed by 10 minutes of questions and exchanges. In order to sen
 d a proposition\, you will need to send an abstract of 200-300 words\, the
  title of your presentation\, your name and affiliation before 25 July 201
 5. Acceptations will be notified by 31 August\, and the programme will be 
 sent out shortly afterwards.\n\nWhy Interculturality?\n\nThe concept of in
 terculturality has been largely used for the past thirty years in scientif
 ic literature (anthropology\, management\, sociology\, psychology\, educat
 ion\, etc) but its presence per se has hardly been critically questioned. 
 Interculturality gathers different notions\, approaches and communicative 
 skills\, and its core probably draws on interactions between speakers/inte
 ractants who do not necessarily share the same linguistic and/or cultural 
 codes. Other approaches hint towards transculturality\, cross-culturality\
 , intraculturality\, multiculturalism or pluriculturalism\, but ultimately
  share the same goal: trying to understand what happens when interactions 
 fail\, especially when communicative codes are so different that misunders
 tandings might occur too often.\n\nIn many ways\, works on interculturalit
 y may remain trapped in wishful thinking. However\, scholars have been wor
 king on critical\, applied or soft versions of interculturality\, by focus
 ing on diversity and commonalities\, rather than dwelling on differences a
 nd the incommensurable ontologies of human societies (Greenfeld 2000\, Hal
 ter 2000\, Wikan 2002\, Anderson 2006\, Lawson 2006\, Lindholm 2008\, Benh
 abib 2009\, Breidenbach & Nyiri 2009\, Phillips 2009\, Gilbert 2010\, Pill
 er 2011\, Dervin 2011\, Holliday 2011\, Keating 2013). Especially in Europ
 e\, where a crisis of national identity and rising right-wing parties seem
  to question the very basis of the management of diversity in democratic r
 egimes\, the questions raised by intercultural debates remain crucial if w
 e wish to improve education to otherness\, as well as social and economic 
 exchanges between citizens. In this very perspective\, exchanges between s
 tudents\, teachers and scholars within common projects may contribute to t
 hese questions\, in order to foster mutual comprehension and respectful re
 cognition.

SUMMARY:Verb Second in Grammar and Processing: Its Causes and Its Conseque
 nces
DTSTART;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20160224T000000
DTEND;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20160226T000000

DESCRIPTION:The verb second (V2) property seen in most Germanic but also i
 n some other Indoeuropean or even extra-Indoeuropean languages may be part
  of a wider variational scenario in which particular features (as encoded 
 in the finite verb) must be represented in the left clausal periphery (cf.
  Anderson\, 1993). Although the V2 property has received much attention in
  the syntactic literature\, there is still dissent which functional projec
 tions/steps of movement are involved in the derivation of V2 order or if i
 t is even base generated. Furthermore\, it is still unclear if the V2 orde
 r is a purely structural linearization condition\, or if it is tied to the
  semantic component in narrow syntax\, as proposed for German (Truckenbrod
 t\, 2006). Every generalization must also consider the variation among V2 
 languages concerning basic word order\, clause types which exhibit V2 (mai
 n clause\, embedded clause\, relative clause)\, and co-occurrence of V2 or
 der and complementizers. \n\nL1-acquisition research suggests that childre
 n acquire the V2-property of German as a secondary step after having settl
 ed for head-final basic word order (Clahsen and Muysken\, 1986). For L2-ac
 quisition it is reported that the acquisition process runs through a fixed
  order of structural hypotheses which differ from L1-acquisition patterns.
  These findings suggest that the V2 is a derived order. \n\nDespite the co
 nsideration of V2 in theoretical work\, the consequences of V2 for sentenc
 e processing have not received much attention. For instance\, German has b
 een mostly studied with respect to its underlying verb-final order. But th
 e early availability of the morphological and lexical verb information in 
 V1/V2 may have important consequences for the parsing process. For instanc
 e Knoeferle et al. (2005) showed that the verbal information is immediatel
 y used in anticipating upcoming event participants. Other aspects of verb 
 related interpretation processes\, however\, such as covert reconstruction
  of quantifiers (Bott and Schlotterbeck\, 2015)\, thematic prominence effe
 cts (Scheepers et al.\, 2000)\, and NPI licensing (Freitag and Bayer\, 201
 5) seem to be delayed to the right clause boundary\, i. e. the supposed ba
 se position of the finite verb.\n\nBy bringing together researchers from d
 ifferent linguistic subdisciplines\, this workshop aims to come one step c
 loser to a deeper understanding of V2\, and to find directions for future 
 research.\n\nInvited Speakers:\n\nMarkus Bader (Goethe-Universität Frankf

DESCRIPTION:Keynote speech by Jacob Eisenstein (Georgia Institute of Techn
 ology)\n\nThe DiSpoL Workshop aims at bringing together researchers from d
 ifferent areas working on theoretical and methodological issues in the fie
 ld of discourse and corpus annotation.\n\nEffective discourse in any langu
 age is characterised by clear relations between sentences and coherent str
 ucture. But languages vary in how relations and structure are signaled\, a
 nd the same is true for different text types and modes. While most discour
 se-annotated resources are based on written text\, less work has been done
  on annotating and investigating discourse relations in spoken language. I
 t is exactly this domain in which we expect crucial differences concerning
  the realisation of discourse relations and discourse structure.\n\nThe Di
 SpoL workshop will focus on the identification and annotation of discourse
  relations in spoken language and in spoken-like text types such as comput
 er-mediated communication or user-generated content from social media. Thi
 s will raise questions concerning additional properties (and classes) of d
 iscourse-relational devices (DRDs) present in spoken data that are not cap
 tured by frameworks developed for written texts. How can these be identifi
 ed and annotated in terms of categories designed for written language?\n\n
 The overall goal of the workshop is the development of a unified annotatio
 n framework for DRDs that will increase the inter-operability of existing 
 resources (such as the Penn Discourse Treebank\, the RST Discourse Treeban
 k\, ...) and that is applicable to different languages and text types\, in
 cluding spoken and written dimensions.\n\nKeynote speech by Jacob Eisenste

SUMMARY:II Congress “Formas y Fórmulas de Tratamiento en el Mundo Hisp

DESCRIPTION:The volume Formas y Fórmulas de Tratamiento en el Mundo Hisp
 ánico\, published by Martin Hummel\, Bettina Kluge\, María Eugenia Vázq
 uez Laslop (2010)\, has offered a tentative state of the art and stimulate
 d the scientific discussion in this area of research. However\, this has o
 nly partly been achieved\, the domains of history and diachrony having bee
 n neglected. Moreover\, the results of research should be placed in an int
 ercultural context since innovations and trends are not restricted to sing
 le languages or nations. The weakening of Spanish vos and the rise of uste
 d(es) in Spanish are better understood if we take into account the develop
 ment of Portugal vós and você(s). The same holds for the expansion of in
 formal T-forms in many countries. From a variationist point of view\, inno
 vative trends coexist with conservative ones\, especially when social iden
 tity plays a role\, e.g.\, vos in Argentina or usted in Mérida (Venezuela
 )\, which comes close to the generalized você in Brazil. Methodologically
 \, synchronic variation may help us reconstruct diachrony\, e.g.\, when pr
 esent-day variants can be related with sporadic documentation in the writt
 en sources used in diachronic research\, providing additional relevance.\n
 \nThe Congress mirrors the methodological interest of the complementary ap
 proaches outlined above:\n\n- The comparative analysis of forms of address
  in the luso-brazilian and Spanish world\n- The historical and diachronic 
 analysis of forms of address in Portuguese and Spanish\n- The diachronic r
 econstruction of forms and systems of address from synchronic variation\n\
 nThe Congress is a joint initiative of Célia dos Santos Lopes (Universida
 de Federal do Rio de Janeiro) and Martin Hummel (University of Graz). It i
 s intended that a second congress would follow\, to be held probably in Ri
 o de Janeiro.\n\nThe Congress aims at preserving the democratic and libera
 l spirit of the previous meeting held in Graz. Therefore\, no invited spea
 kers or other figureheads are planned. This allows us to provide financial
  support to the participants who need it. A scientific committee shall eva
 luate the abstracts in order to select the papers for inclusion\, based on
  criteria of quality. Our intention is to create a lively and ongoing netw
 ork of communication between those interested by joining us.\n\nTime and P

SUMMARY:Use of Hedges in Academic Writing by EFL Learners
DTSTART;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20150726T000000
DTEND;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20150731T000000
UID:http://linguistlist.org/issues/25/25-3224.html
DESCRIPTION:English has been the language of worldwide communication for d
 ecades\, and\, in addition to English native speakers\, millions of people
  study and/or use it all over the planet. Since its usage is so widespread
 \, pragmatics comes into play\, especially the concept of pragmatic compet
 ence. Bardovi-Harlig and Dornyei (1998) claim that “grammatical developm
 ent does not guarantee a corresponding level of pragmatic development”\,
  so it is important to analyze the extent to which learners are developing
  pragmatic competence as well as grammatical competence.\n\nThe study of l
 earners’ pragmatic development falls into the field of interlanguage pra
 gmatics\, which can be defined as “the study of nonnative speakers’ co
 mprehension\, production\, and acquisition of linguistic action in L2” (
 Kasper\, 2012). One feature of pragmatic competence that can be investigat
 ed under interlanguage pragmatics is the use of hedges by non-native speak
 ers of English\, especially in terms of academic writing. Lakoff (1973) de
 scribes the term as “words whose job is to make things fuzzier or less f
 uzzy” and Fraser (2010) defines hedging as “a rhetorical strategy that
  attenuates either the full semantic value of a particular expression or t
 he full force of a speech act”. Hinkel (2005) states that “few studies
  have addressed specifically how trained NNS writers employ hedges and int
 ensifiers in their written academic texts\, although such an analysis can 
 be useful in developing curricula for L2 writing instruction.”\n\nIt is 
 also important to highlight the importance of the analysis of academic wri
 ting. When comparing native and learner corpora of academic writing it is 
 possible to notice some features in the phraseology of learners of English
  as a Foreign Language that evidently show their non-nativeness. According
  to De Cock (2003)\, EFL learners have been shown to overuse a limited num
 ber of frequent English collocations and prefabs but to underuse a whole s
 et of native-like phraseological units. Many studies also point out that t
 here is a potential influence of the learner’s native language in academ
 ic writing. \n\nTherefore\, the aim of the panel is to bring together stud
 ies in the development of pragmatic competence and interlanguage pragmatic
 s\, focused on the use of hedges in academic writing by non-native speaker
 s of English through the use of learner corpora of academic writing.

DESCRIPTION:The fifth conference in the languagetalks-series\, organized b
 y members of the Graduate School Language & Literature Munich\, will take 
 place in the IBZ Munich from 24 to 26 February 2016. The topic of the conf
 erence will be:\n\nCrisis\nImaginations and Representations of an Oft-Quot
 ed Notion\n\nCrisis\, a term that can convey both chance and chaos\, has i
 n recent decades become a fashionable concept. Crisis is present in everyd
 ay discourse\; a popular figure in modern media and cultural studies. Its 
 common usage in social controversies as well as acute clashes in political
  and military contexts represents a wide range of conditions associated wi
 th the terminology of crisis: from the problems of a deficient educational
  system that permanently seem to fester in the background to the conjuring
  of doomsday scenarios linked to concrete conflicts and states of emergenc
 y. The more frequently the term is evoked\, the more difficult it is to de
 fine\; what makes a crisis a crisis?\n\nAssuming a specific life cycle of 
 crises\, the question arises of whether its beginning and end are actually
  already determined. Conversely\, considering an actor perspective\, how a
 re these phases\, and their popular acceptance\, determined and mediated? 
 In what conditions can a crisis be declared? Is the end characterised by m
 edia silence\, or is this also staged?\n\nLanguagetalks seeks to pursue di
 fferent conceptualisations\, manifestations\, and effects of crisis across
  the disciplinary perspectives of cultural history\, linguistics\, and lit
 erary studies. Rather than considering this much-quoted term as an ontolog
 ical category\, we aim to interrogate crisis as a cultural and linguistic 
 construct with various and varying characteristics depending upon the dive
 rse forms of representations in changing media. The issues to be discussed
  include\, but are not limited to:\n\n(1) Identity and Crisis\n\n(2) Liter
 ary Depictions of Crisis\n\n(3) Language in Crises\nLanguage itself can be
  the subject of a crisis debate\, if\, for example\, elements of a foreign
  language are perceived as a threat to the integrity of a local language a
 nd culture. Often\, language also serves as a vehicle for forming and cons
 tructing identity\; foreign speakers might suffer socio-cultural exclusion
 \, lacking access to the nuances of specific communicational means within 
 a society. Another very prominent linguistic feature of crises is the form
 ation of neologisms\, e.g. with the suffix –gate. Originating from the W
 atergate Scandal in 1972\, adding –gate to keywords of certain discourse
 s will add a connotation of scandal\, deficiency\, or outrage. Examples ar
 e: Nipplegate (entertainment)\, Fingergate (politics)\, Deflategate (sport
 s)\, or Antennagate (technology). Apart from that\, existing (potentially 
 simple) words or phrases can be altered in their semantic and pragmatic fu
 nctions. Using them in an exposed manner\, e.g. as a rhetoric figure\, mig
 ht change their message in a significant manner. In this way Obama’s “
 Yes we can” formed a popular political lexeme.

SUMMARY:Dialogue Under Occupation VII

DESCRIPTION:The focus of “Dialogue Under Occupation” is the ongoing ex
 ploration of dialogue and discourse in areas of the world experiencing occ
 upation with an eye toward resolution.\n\nDialogue is presented as a compl
 ex concept\, requiring 1) the participants\; 2) the conditions for dialogu
 e to commence\; 3) the goal(s) of the dialogue—pre-established or arrive
 d at through the dialogue itself. First\, a minimum of two parties (i.e.\,
  individuals or groups of individuals representing a side or perspective) 
 must be present. Second\, conditions may include preconditions necessary t
 o bring the parties together\, procedures for engaging in dialogue\, and a
  certain degree of mutual respect\, without which the dialogue could not p
 roceed and will not lead to any resolutions. Lastly\, the dialogue itself 
 must have a purpose—a common\, achievable goal that participants can agr
 ee upon despite their differing perspectives. Purposeful dialogue has the 
 potential to lead to an outcome that recognizes and respects the needs of 
 the various participants while emerging with an agreement which all partie
 s can abide.\n\nOccupation\, however\, is a complicating factor which crea
 tes a power differential between participants: the occupied and the occupi
 ers. If dialogue under occupation is to be successful\, then\, the conditi
 ons must include 1) the realization that the power differential exists\; a
 nd 2) the willingness of the powerful to concede their preconceived\, ofte
 n hegemonic\, notions of their position. It must also be understood by all
  parties that engaging in dialogue under occupation does not mean that the
  less powerful or powerless are accepting the occupation in any form\, but
  that they are willing to confront their occupiers in an effort to be reco
 gnized as having equal human rights\, including the ability to make autono
 mous decisions about how they should live and pursue their own definition 
 of happiness.

DESCRIPTION:The 4th International Conference on Language Documentation and
  Conservation will feature NSF-Supported Special Sessions on Pedagogy in L
 anguage Conservation. Each session will contain four talks and will be foc
 used on a theme relating to the notion of pedagogy for endangered language
  teaching.\n\nEndangered language teaching in the language community is of
 ten informed by only the most generic of language pedagogies\, and languag
 e teachers are often frustrated by the lack of methodologies that go beyon
 d short conversation\, basic vocabulary\, and constructions that can be ta
 ught by methods like Total Physical Response (e.g.\, Asher 1969). Compound
 ing the problem\, these same trained teachers may not have enough linguist
 ic knowledge of the subject language to develop robust teaching materials 
 and programs\, while linguists with command of linguistic structure may no
 t have the teaching training required to properly educate students or info
 rm language teachers.\n\nIn the past we have followed the “Ken Hale” m
 odel of training endangered language speakers in linguistics. We have crea
 ted reference grammars and pedagogical grammars\, and most documentation p
 rojects include some component for creating teaching materials. What is st
 ill lacking from the discipline is a systematic discussion of how to trans
 form documentary materials like annotated corpora and reference grammars i
 nto an effective pedagogical workflow for endangered languages (e.g.\, ref
 erence grammar to pedagogical grammar to teaching materials to pedagogical
  methods to assessment of teaching programs). There is a disconnect betwee
 n linguistic theory and pedagogical theory\, and we aim to bridge this gap
  during these Special Sessions.

DESCRIPTION:Walter Bisang (Mainz) & Balthasar Bickel (Zürich) & Gisbert F
 anselow (Potsdam) & Hubert Haider (Salzburg)\n\nVO-OV: Correlations of hea
 d-complement order in grammar and lexicon\n\nThe distinction between OV an
 d VO order in a clause is usually taken to be a good predictor of fur-ther
  serialization facts\, and one can find several proposal for an explanatio
 n of the corresponding implicative universals in the literature. Possible 
 further correlates of the VO-OV distinction in do-mains other than word or
 der such as the following have been investigated to a much lesser extent. 
 The data represented in WALS shows that the percentage of languages withou
 t a morphological system of case is lower among the OV languages. Likewise
 \, there are more OV than OV systems among the languages with an ergative 
 case pattern\,  while VO languages are overrepresented among the languages
  which position question words at the clause's left periphery. \n\nOther c
 orrelations have been proposed on the basis of much smaller\, non-represen
 tative language samples. Thus\, it has been claimed that free constituent 
 order (scrambling) and the absence of typical subject-object asymmetries a
 re concomitant of OV order\, and it has been argued that OV languages have
  a higher N:V ratio in the lexicon. There are interesting proposal as to h
 ow such correlations can be modeled in a theory of language. \n\nInvited s
 peakers are Mathew Dryer and Ad Neeleman.

DESCRIPTION:As part of the 38th Annual Conference of the German Linguistic
  Society (DGfS 2016)\, we will organize a workshop on:\n\nSentence complex
 ity at the boundary of grammatical theory and processing: A special challe
 nge for language acquisition\n\nInvited Speakers:\n\nShravan Vasishth\, Un
 iversity of Potsdam\, Germany\nLuigi Rizzi\, University of Siena\, Italy\,
  Université de Genève\, Switzerland\n\nComplex sentences (e.g.\, relativ
 e clauses\, wh-questions\, passives\, clefts\, extractions from weak islan
 ds) are considerably challenging for children who acquire their first or s
 econd language but also for adults when they are tested under time pressur
 e. Attempts to explain the effects of sentence complexity have developed\,
  at least\, along two directions. On one hand\, theoretical linguists have
  been aiming to clarify the nature of sentence complexity\, how it manifes
 ts itself within one language and across different languages and under whi
 ch conditions the grammaticality of complex sentences is disrupted (e.g.\,
  Rizzi\, 2013). Grammatical theories of sentence complexity have also been
  used to interpret children’s non adult-like performance on experimental
  tasks. On the other hand\, psycholinguists and cognitive scientists have 
 assessed how individuals understand various types of complex sentences eit
 her in real time (whilst they read or listen to them) or off-line (after t
 he sentence is completed). These results have shown interesting difference
 s and similarities across languages and populations and they have enriched
  our knowledge on how language interacts with other cognitive abilities (e
 .g.\, Lewis\, Vasishth\, & Van Dyke\, 2006). Recent attempts have been mad
 e to establish a dialogue between the grammatical and processing accounts 
 (e.g. Lewis & Phillips\, 2015) thereby reviving the interest in the relati
 on between grammar and mental processes.\n\nThe aim of this 3-day-workshop
  is to bring these two perspectives on language together in order to promo
 te a cross-fertilization of the two accounts\, focusing in particular on t
 he following issues:\n\n- Which cognitive and linguistic changes allow the
  transition between the developing (child) parser and the adult parser?\n-
  How could current syntactic theory\, sentence processing models and memor
 y retrieval mechanisms be used to explain how children learn to deal with 
 sentence complexity?\n- Do the effects of complexity on language acquisiti
 on and language processing originate in grammar (i.e.\, syntax) or are the
 y a result of increased demands on extra-linguistic cognitive capacities (
 e.g.\, working memory\, cognitive control\, neighboring interfaces)? Or bo
 th?\n- Is there a way to reconcile the two approaches? What is the relatio
 n to complexity issues from other linguistic areas such as semantics and p
 honology?\n\nReferences:\n\nLewis\, Shevaun & Phillips\, Colin. 2015. Alig

  current linguistic studies as well as in current multidisciplinary studie

DESCRIPTION:Globalising Sociolinguistics. Challenging the Anglo-Western na
 ture of Sociolinguistics and expanding theories\n\n18-20 June 2015\nLeiden
  University\, Netherlands\n\nTheoretical Mismatches:\n\nThis conferences a
 ddresses mismatches between mainstream sociolinguistic models and non-Angl
 o-Western sociolinguistic settings. Papers are invited on sociolinguistic 
 issues\, from various areas in the world\, which challenge or expand mains
 tream theories. Both theoretical and empirical contributions are welcome. 
 Papers will explore sociolinguistic settings in various regions\, focusing
  on difficulties in applying common theory in the region in question\, or 
 the need to expand theory. In so doing\,  the conference hopes to lay bare
  the nature and the mechanisms related to the named bias and arrive at a m
 ore comprehensive understanding of sociolinguistic issues around the world
 .\n\nA combined European\, American and British dominance is known to exis
 t in sociolinguistic theory-making. This results in difficulties in using 
 several dominant sociolinguistic models outside their ‘western’ geogra
 phical domain. Most researchers working outside this domain are keenly awa
 re of this\, and hence objections to this dominance are regularly vented b
 y them. However\, despite the fact that non-Anglo-Western language setting
 s are described extensively in a multitude of publications\, these setting
 s somehow seem to contribute less to mainstream theory and are implicitly 
 regarded as deviant.\n\nThis conference will also celebrate the publicatio
 n of the Routledge volume ‘Globalising Sociolinguistics’\, which is to
  appear early 2015. This volume contains 19 chapters – written by 27 aut
 hors\, from all continents – describing the sociolinguistic situations i
 n various regions and speech communities in the world. Each chapter descri
 bes a number of mismatches between mainstream sociolinguistic theory and t
 he situation in the specific region/community. A number of authors will be
  present at the conference. \n\nPlenary Speakers:\n\nFlorian Coulmas. Dire

DESCRIPTION:Increasing multilingualism is one of the characteristic featur
 es of all Baltic-Sea European societies today. Additionally to the numerou
 s regional and minority languages\, the linguistic landscapes are enriched
  by ever new migrant languages. Public interest in multilingualism and the
  ways of managing it grows continuously as well. Nevertheless\, as shown b
 y the results of the interdisciplinary EU-FP7 project ELDIA (2010-2013\, s
 ee www.eldia-project.org)\, many problems still need to be solved even in 
 the Nordic societies which generally have a good international reputation 
 in minority matters. At the micro level\, the intensifying international m
 obility of people necessitates a conscious strengthening of mutual underst
 anding\, more tolerance towards linguistic and ethnic differences\, as wel
 l as more flexibility in one's individual everyday social practices. In br
 ief\, finding and implementing effective and sustainable macro- and micro-
 level measures of coping with the new forms of multilingualism and for mai
 ntaining and reinforcing the traditional minority and regional languages a
 re urgently required.\n\nThe conference is scheduled to be followed by the
  inaugural conference of the International Society of Literary Linguistics
 \, taking place in Mainz on 15-17 April 2015. The two conferences will be 
 bridged by a set of papers concerned with multilingualism in literature. T
 he organizers of the current conference also specifically invite contribut
 ions to the study of the use and the representations of multilingualism in
  literature.\n\nThe confirmed invited speakers and the thematic fields of 
 their keynote papers are:\n\n- Karin Hoyer (The Finnish Association of the

DESCRIPTION:The intellectual landscape of the Classical world was radicall
 y altered by the rise and spread of Christianity\, which brought about a t
 ransformation of moral and cultural values\, beliefs and attitudes. Profou
 nd changes also occurred in the practical and theoretical approaches to la
 nguages as cognitive\, ethnic and cultural phenomena. The linguistic horiz
 on of Western scholars was considerably widened through direct acquaintanc
 e with the Old Testament languages (Hebrew and Aramaic)\; at the same time
  Early Christian authors became increasingly aware of the startling lingui
 stic diversity within the Roman world and outside of it. \n\nIntended for 
 an audience of scholars in a wide variety of fields (philology\, theology\
 , philosophy\, language sciences\, history of ideas)\, this interdisciplin
 ary conference will approach the general issue of “Language and Culture 
 in Early Christianity” from two complementary perspectives:\n\n(I) A con
 text-oriented perspective\, focusing on the linguistic horizon\, the cultu
 ral background\, and the sociohistorical setting of Early Christian approa
 ches to language(s). Possible topics to be treated in connection with ling
 uistic ideas are: the role of the Greek\, Syriac\, and Coptic philosophica
 l and theological traditions\; the role of the Jewish tradition of textual
  study of the Old Testament\; the role of apocryphal writings\; first-hand
  knowledge of\, or second-hand information on languages other than Greek o
 r Latin\; the impact of key players\, intellectual networks\, and authorit
 ative texts on Early Christian approaches to language(s).\n\n(II) A conten
 t-oriented perspective\, focusing on arguments\, views or intuitions expre
 ssed with regard to: the origin of language\; language functions (both cog
 nitive-semiotic and cultural-anthropological)\; the connections between la
 nguage\, culture and ethnicity\; language variation and global linguistic 
 diversity\; the relevance of language to theology\; the role of language i
 n ancient education\; problems of translation and the general issue of tra
 nslatability\; the “qualities” and “deficiencies” of particular la
 nguages.\n\nKeynote Speakers:\n\nThorsten Fögen\nAlfons Fürst\nLouis Hol

 che Probleme der Untersuchung von Sprach- kodifizierungen erörtert werde
 n\, andererseits ausgewählte Details und Pilotstudien zu einzelnen Aspek

DESCRIPTION:National Interdisciplinary Conference on Current Issues of Eng
 lish Teaching and Learning (NICCIETL) is a national conference organized b
 y Pazoheshgaran Andishmand Institute\, Ahwaz\, Iran.\n\nThe NICCIETL will 
 be held on March 4-6\, 2015 and will be dedicated to current trends and de
 velopments in English teaching and learning studies.\n\nAcademics and univ
 ersity lecturers are cordially invited to present their research regarding
  current issues of English teaching and learning as people who can help th
 e field of English teaching and learning. Such an approach suggests that E
 nglish education is no longer limited within a certain field\; knowledge f
 rom different fields cultivates diversity in English education. Recognizin
 g this trend\, the NICCIEITL Organizing Committee aims to provide a platfo
 rm for researchers from various fields to exchange ideas on issues related
  to the empowerment of English teaching and learning.

SUMMARY:Fabula Agitur! Theatrical and Artistic Practices in Grenoble
DTSTART;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20150128T000000
DTEND;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20150130T000000

DESCRIPTION:In recent years\, specialists in language instruction have pai
 d much attention to the contribution of theatrical practices - and\, more 
 broadly speaking\, of artistic practices - to the learning of modern langu
 ages. This symposium intends to look into a body of work that has so far b
 een neglected: artistic practices used as a way to teach Ancient Languages
 \, whether at school\, college\, or in local associations\, in France and 
 abroad.\n\nThanks to the stage\, acting and oracy\, this approach may be m
 ore physical and more emotional than those they are used to encountering i
 n the classroom\, in terms of what the Common European Framework of Refere
 nce for Languages (CEFR) calls 'knowledge'\, 'skills' and 'existential com
 petences' (three macro-categories that apply to each form of learning).\n\
 nSo far\, these many and varied practices have not been taken into account
  in any theoretical analysis or synthesis\; at most\, we are presented wit
 h field reports. This symposium is intended to address this lack of scient
 ific background.\n\nBy using an approach inspired by research into languag
 e instruction\, it will be asked how performing a song in Latin\, Greek or
  Old Irish\, or how producing a play in Latin\, Ancient Greek or Sanskrit 
 may be helpful in the process of learning these difficult languages\, or i
 n the process of discovering very distant cultures and literary traditions
 . Moreover\, this kind of learning is not just directed towards oral fluen
 cy\, but towards the reading of texts\, situated in their proper context. 
 So what kinds of specific problems are caused by the teaching of these lan
 guages\, and how can the stage help to solve them\, if at all? How can tea
 chers find time to adopt theatre activities in Ancient Languages in school
  curricula? Which specific aspects of Ancient Language learning can be mad
 e easier through artistic practices? Are there any exercises that match sp
 ecific grammar points\, vocabulary development\, poetic meter or even cult
 ural studies? Which other cross-disciplinary skills may be developed? Is t
 he opening up to other apprenticeships made easier? To what extent does th
 e educational institution encourage such an approach? What support and tra
 ining can voluntary teachers be eligible for? And finally\, how do pupils\
 , students and parents respond to these approaches?\n\nThe performances cr
 eated by these practices will also be considered in an aesthetic perspecti
 ve\, inspired by studies on the performing arts. Do they focus mainly on t
 exts and plays belonging to the Ancient era or to a later repertoire (Medi
 eval and Renaissance texts as far as Latin and Greek are concerned)\, or i
 nstead on re-writings\, literary patchworks\, or even ex nihilo creations?
  If so\, how and by whom are these new texts created? Does the staging of 
 Ancient plays take into account recent research into Ancient Drama? Do the
 se productions offer archeological reconstructions or contemporary interpr
 etations? How is Latin and Greek pronunciation dealt with? Is poetic meter
  addressed at all? How is acting exactly defined? And what about the choru
 s\, dance\, music and singing? \n\nThe symposium will be held at Stendhal 
 University - Grenoble III (France) from January 28 to January 30\, 2015. C
 onference participants will be offered short training sessions on Ancient 
 Language theatre as well as two theatrical performances which will clearly
  display the benefits of artistic practices for the learning of Ancient La
 nguages and Cultures.

DESCRIPTION:Aim and Theme of the Conference: \n\nSince de Lauretis introdu
 ced queer theory as “another discursive horizon\, another way of thinkin
 g the sexual” (1991:iv)\, this approach has played an important role in 
 the analysis of sex and gender in Literary\, Film and Cultural Studies. De
 spite its claim of interdisciplinarity\, Translation Studies has yet to fu
 lly integrate the concepts and theoretical instruments of Queer Studies. I
 f Queer Studies problematizes the representation of otherness\, then Trans
 lation Studies highlights the otherness of representation. Bringing togeth
 er Queer Studies and Translation Studies\, therefore\, should destablize n
 ot only traditional models of representation\, understood  as mimesis\, re
 flection\, copying\, but also the authorial voices and subjectivities they
  produce.\n\nThe aim of this conference is to explore the common ground\, 
 both on a theoretical and practical level\, of the two disciplines and to 
 promote cross-fertilization by bringing together scholars from different c
 ultures with various research backgrounds. \n\nKeynote Speakers:\n\nBrian

 ’un projet de recherche éponyme lancé en Suède au début du siècle.\
 n\nThe conference series 'Français parlé des médias' derives from an ep

 nLa cinquième édition du colloque Le Français parlé dans les médias t
 raitera de l’impact de la langue parlée dans les médias.\n\nLe frança
 is  - et d’autres langues comparées à lui - sera considéré préfére
 ntiellement dans sa forme orale\, mais également dans sa forme écrite\, 
 lorsqu’elle comporte des caractéristiques d’oralité : stylistiques (
 écriture journalistique en ligne)\, ou génériques (interview écrite\, 
 chat\, forum). Les manifestations linguistiques en seront observées dans 
 les différents médias qu’ils soient qualifiés de « traditionnels » 
 (presse écrite\, radio-télévision) ou de « nouveaux » – une distinc
 tion qui ne manquera pas d’être elle-même interrogée.\n\nLe colloque 
 interrogera l’impact sur le français des  pratiques médiatiques de l
 ’information\, du divertissement\, de la culture (à l’inclusion du ci
 néma et du théâtre) et de la publicité ainsi que dans les « nouveaux 
 médias ».\n\nCe colloque s’adresse en priorité aux chercheurs en scie
 nces du langage mais aussi aux chercheurs d’autres disciplines qui s’i
 ntéressent aux discours médiatiques. Il se propose d’être un lieu de 
 questionnement sur les outils théoriques et les méthodes d’approche de
 s objets de recherche mentionnés.\n\nLes conférences plénières seront 
 données par :\n\n- Laurent Fauré (Montpellier 3)\n- Tim Grant (Aston)\n-

SUMMARY:Evidentiality\, Egophoricity and Engagement: Descriptive and Typol
 ogical Perspectives
DTSTART;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20160317T000000
DTEND;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20160318T000000
UID:http://linguistlist.org/issues/26/26-4221.html
DESCRIPTION:It has become increasingly clear over the last 20 years that e
 pistemicity in language houses a number of distinct notions and categories
  that are only partly related to a well explored notion like modality\, wh
 ich by some has been equated with the very notion of epistemicity found in
  different parts of grammar. The aim of the symposium is therefore to cont
 ribute to the ongoing exploration of epistemic marking systems in lesser-d
 ocumented languages from the Americas\, Papua New Guinea\, and Central Asi
 a from the perspective of description and cross-linguistic comparison. \n\
 nAs the title of the symposium suggests\, part of this exploration consist
 s of comparing already established categories such as evidentiality to the
  diversity of systems found in individual languages. We briefly describe t
 he categories that serve as a theme for the symposium:\n\nEvidentiality is
  a category whose core function is to specify how information about an eve
 nt was acquired. As a grammatical category\, evidentiality has been the su
 bject of a substantial amount of research over the last 30 years and the n
 umber of descriptions of diverse evidential systems has grown along with a
 n increasing number of documented and described languages form all parts o
 f the world. \n\nEgophoricity is a typologically unusual grammatical categ
 ory that indicates whether one of the speech-participants was involved in 
 a talked-about event. Egophoric markers are prototypically restricted to o
 ccur in utterances with agentive first\, or second person subjects\, but t
 he pragmatically conditioned meaning inherent to these forms makes this pr
 ototypical distribution subject to change in different languages\, where t
 hey can occur with third person and non-agentive subjects. \n\nEngagement\
 , finally\, is a recently proposed category that focuses on the distributi
 on of knowledge and attention between the speech-participants in terms of 
 (intersubjective) (a)symmetries where the speaker makes assumptions about 
 the addressee’s knowledge/ attention of an event as either shared with t
 he speaker or non-shared\, a contrast that entails the potentially divergi
 ng epistemic perspectives of both speech-participants. Languages\, on whic
 h the proposed category of engagement is based\, are spoken in South Ameri
 ca\, the Himalayas\, and Papua New Guinea.\n\nThe symposium brings togethe
 r researchers working with first and second-hand data relevant to the noti
 on of epistemicity\, as sketched above\, in order to explore new avenues o
 f research and methods for comparing analyses of different\, but purported
 ly related systems. Participants come mainly from Stockholm University and
  Helsinki University as part of a newly instated collaboration program\, b
 ut the organizers invite proposals from outside researchers working on epi
 stemicity in language\, using first hand data\, or typological approaches.
  The symposium will\, however\, not be able to cover travel and accommodat
 ion costs outside of already invited speakers.

SUMMARY:Pragmatics of Grammar: Negation and Polarity
DTSTART;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20150519T000000
DTEND;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20150520T000000
UID:http://linguistlist.org/issues/25/25-1186.html
DESCRIPTION:Chierchia’s latest book (2013) argues that the interpretatio
 n of grammar is structured by logic-based processes following investigatio
 n of negative polarity. A number of behaviours of negation and polarity ha
 ve however been suggested to relate to pragmatic determinisms.\n\n- The bu
 lk of negative polarity uses are found in contexts with a semantic value s
 uccessively defined as affective\, downward-entailing or antiveridical. Si
 nce Linebarger (1987)\, it has been observed that contexts outside these d
 o license NPI when pragmatically charged ('She persisted long after she ha
 d any hope of succeeding'). Expressive indexes have been proposed to chara
 cterise licensing factives (Giannakidou 2006). Unexpected licensing cases 
 have been related to by assertoric inertia where it is the illocutionary p
 oint of the utterance that accounts for the use of NPIs (Horn in preparati
 on).\n- The licensing of NPIs has been envisaged as subject to surface ord
 er constraints such that infelicity would result from precedence of the NP
 I to its licensor ('Anyone didn’t come'). However\, it is not clear that
  such constraints are universal (languages with sentence final negatives b
 eing a case in point)\, and that all NPIs are equally subject to it (Larri
 vée 2007).\n\nRegarding negation itself\, an increasing number of analyse
 s underline the importance of what the negative is responding to\, converg
 ing to illustrate the role of Information Structure for a variety of lingu
 istic phenomena.\n\n- Initially thought to support syntactic analyses\, in
 tervention effects\, where negation makes wh questions infelicitous ( '?* 
 When didn’t she respond?')\, are increasingly seen as relating to pragma
 tic factors (Spector 1996\, Abrusán 2008\, Tomioka 2009). In particular\,
  felicity of negative questions seems to improve significantly when the un
 derlying proposition is a Question Under Discussion\, as suggested by acce
 ptable 'When did she respond and when didn’t she respond?'.\n- Informati
 on Structure also seems to be involved in negative fragment answers and co
 rrections (Vicente 2010)\, as it is for most elliptical structures. It thu
 s may be that fragmentary negative sequences could be interpreted with the
  support of contextual pragmatic information rather than syntactic reconst
 ruction mechanisms.\n- The metalinguistic and descriptive uses of negative
 s have considerable impact on the acceptable discursive follow-ups (Ducrot
  1972\, Horn 2001)\, but to what extent does the relation to antecedent di
 scourse help delineate these two categories? While claims that these categ
 ories relate to different informational patterns are occasionally made\, m
 ore systematic documentation is still awaited.\n- Negative dependencies ha
 ve been extensively studied (Biberauer & Roberts 2011\, Haegeman & Lohndal
  2011\, Zeijlstra 2004 i.a.)\, and unexpectedly\, prosodic (Tubau et al 20
 13) and syntactic (Déprez 2000) triggers do not categorically yield negat
 ive concord or double negation interpretations. Puskas (2012) among others
  has suggested that double negation may be correlated to information parti
 tion in a way that negative concord is not. Again\, such a correlation is 
 awaiting empirical confirmation.\n\nKeynote speaker: Laurence R. Horn (Yal
 e). Negative inversion(s).\n\nConfirmed participants: Jack Hoeksema (Groni
 ngen) on neg-raising and polarity\, Olga Kellert (Berlin) on negation in e
 xclamations and interrogations\, Patrick Duffley (Laval) and Pierre Larriv
 ée (Caen) on polarity in factive contexts.\n\nConfirmed interest: Anastas
 ia Giannakidou (Chicago)\, Michael Israel (Maryland).

DESCRIPTION:Teaching is one of the most challenging professions because it
  brings individuals of different backgrounds (teachers and learners) into 
 a very close relationship. The process of teaching/learning arguably const
 itutes the most important aspect of this relationship\, but it is intimate
 ly connected with other complex personal\, social\, cultural\, and even hi
 storical and political factors. A teacher is not a neutral entity\, nor do
 es s/he teach in a social\, cultural\, and historical vacuum. Similarly\, 
 the learner is not a tabula rasa\, subject to the teacher's inscriptions. 
 Inevitably\, the process of education will elicit critical questions or ev
 en resistance. Teaching foreign languages and literatures to non-native sp
 eakers may pose challenges for both teachers and students. These challenge
 s may be administrative\, technical\, pedagogical\, linguistic\, social\, 
 cultural\, political\, or even a combination of all. This conference aims 
 at exploring these challenges in different teaching situations and environ
 ments.

 dergraduates for the academic and workplace settings.  There are also deve
 lopments in higher education now where Internet and technology have forced
  institutions to rethink new ways to teach\, learn and do research to addr

 g access to rich ideas on the excellence of teaching language proficiency 
 amongst language practitioners at tertiary level via its inaugural seminar
  for language teaching and learning. The seminar\, ‘Contextual Diversity
  in Language Teaching and Learning’ hopes to bring together language ins
 tructors\, academics\, researchers\, scholars and students with interest a

  of concern.\n\nThe objectives of the seminar are:\n\n- To provide a platf
 orm for the exchange of ideas\, insights\, research findings and expertise
  amongst language practitioners\, academics\, students and other intereste
 d parties\n- To provide a forum for language practitioners\, academics\, s
 tudents and other interested parties to discuss issues in the development 
 of language skills among language learners\n- To discuss new developments 
 in teaching practices\n- To promote research related to the field of langu
 age teaching and learning.=

SUMMARY:Metapragmatics of Humor: Crossing the Boundaries
DTSTART;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20150726T000000
DTEND;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20150731T000000
UID:http://linguistlist.org/issues/25/25-3004.html
DESCRIPTION:The aim of this panel is to reflect some facts related to humo
 r acquisition in children\, as well as to the use of humor as adaptability
 \, negotiability and variability in adults.\n\nHumor acquisition: Every co
 mmunicative use of language involves the metapragmatic awareness which det
 ermines the linguistic choices. Thus\, comprehension of contextual propert
 ies\, along with the role of participants\, organizes the linguistic form 
 of the message (cfr. Verschueren 1999). However\, such awareness is not co
 nstant or equal for all speakers\, since the different circumstances have 
 an influence on its degree. Furthermore\, the maturity of the working memo
 ry is key to the metapragmatic competence (Gombert 1992\; Crespo & Alvarad
 o 2010).\n\nHumor\, conceived as a metapragmatic ability\, is acquired by 
 children in a progressive way according to their cognitive maturity. In th
 is sense\, infants show early their pragmatic ability of using linguistic 
 elements as indicators of humor. However\, in these initial stages such ab
 ility is based in a rather automatic fitting to the contextual features (e
 pi-pragmatic period). Over the years\, children undergo an evolution towar
 ds the clearly metapragmatic conception when they begin to check their lin
 guistic choices with the contextual data (Buđevac\, Anđelković\, Savić
  2009\; Crespo & Alfaro 2009).\n\nHumor as adaptability: The different lin
 guistic choices made by a speaker in a humorous text are not independent o
 r isolated mechanisms\, since they are an example of language use as a who
 le (Verschueren\, 1999\; 2009). Speakers observe the range of variables am
 ong the possible choices\; they negotiate such choices in context\; and\, 
 finally\, they adapt them to achieve their basic aim\, i.e.\, to amuse the
  audience\, to make it laugh\, etc. More precisely\, the adaptability to a
  specific context is the mechanism which provokes laughter or provides amu
 sement among the audience of a humorous text. Such linguistic and paraling
 uistic choices act as markers and indicators of humour\, making the infere
 nce process easier. Therefore\, they are directly linked to the logical me
 chanisms\, the narrative strategies (genre\, text and register) and the co
 mmunicative situation in which the text is involved. These knowledge resou
 rces support the humorous characterization of a text\, according to the Ge
 neral Theory of Verbal Humor (Attardo\, 2001\; 2008\; and his revisions: R
 uiz-Gurillo\, 2012\; 2013\; Tsakona\, 2013). \n\nContributions in English 
 and Spanish are welcome.

UID:http://linguistlist.org/issues/26/26-4157.html
DESCRIPTION:In the light of the growing heterogeneity of students in our f
 oreign language classrooms\, teachers face additional challenges in terms 
 of inclusion. Educational inclusion is based on a conceptualisation of thi
 s heterogeneity in terms of valued diversity rather than as a teaching obs
 tacle. The proposed colloquium aims to contribute to debates on inclusion 
 by discussing how linguistics (in its broadest sense) can contribute to ma
 king the foreign language classroom more inclusive.\n\nIn regular classroo
 ms\, certain (groups of) learners may face linguistic or communicative bar
 riers at various language-related levels that potentially endanger their l
 anguage learning success. In the inclusive language classroom\, teachers a
 im at individualised language teaching that caters for the needs of all st
 udents in class. To reach this goal\, critical language-related research n
 eeds to study how exclusion manifests itself\, for example\, in relation t
 o participation in classroom interaction\, the representation of social ac
 tors in textbooks or other teaching materials\, or the ignorance or neglig
 ence of specific learners’ L1 backgrounds in foreign language teaching. 
 A central dimension of inclusive education is the role that language plays
  in social processes of inclusion\, exclusion\, normalisation and stigmati
 sation.\n\nColloquium organiser: Heiko Motschenbacher\, Goethe-University\

SUMMARY:Pragmatics of Genre Formation

UID:http://linguistlist.org/issues/25/25-2801.html
DESCRIPTION:Although genres are conceptualized differently in different th
 eories\, a general consensus exists that they are semiotic forms of social
  action which reflect the social purpose they serve in the group(s) that u
 se(s) them (e.g. Ehlich & Rehbein\, 1986\; Martin\, 1992\; Miller\, 1994).
  Much less consensus\, however\, exists on the question of how stable (or 
 not) genres are and how new genres come into existence. The phenomenon of 
 genre-emergence gives rise to a series of interesting\, yet so far under-r
 esearched\, questions:\n\n- Under which conditions do new genres “emerge
 ” (bottom-up) from existing ones and when are they “implemented” (to
 p-down) in more or less formal ways?\n- How do different macro-contextual 
 forces (like social and political transformations\, technological innovati
 ons\, historical and institutional changes\, etc.) impact the (micro-level
 ) everyday communicative practices in which genres are realized?\n- Do new
  communicative forms (like social media platforms) have a “pulling” ef
 fect (in the sense that they stimulate new communicative needs) on the for
 mation of new genres?\n- How are the contextual (social\, institutional\, 
 technological\, political) factors that influence genre formation are acco
 unted for in different linguistic genre theories?\n\nBeing aware that each
  of these questions can be answered differently according to the theoretic
 al angle under which they are approached and according to the empirical da
 ta which are investigated\, the panel aims at bringing together scholars w
 ho have been investigating various aspects of the formation of new genres 
 in historical media studies\, communication in social media and various se
 ttings of institutional discourse.

SUMMARY:Indexing Gender Revisited: On the Non-Referential Aspects of Gende
 ring
DTSTART;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20150726T000000
DTEND;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20150731T000000
UID:http://linguistlist.org/issues/25/25-2918.html
DESCRIPTION:The point of departure for this panel is the ground-breaking p
 aper 'Indexing gender' authored by Elinor Ochs in 1992. In that paper\, Oc
 hs draws attention to the fact that words\, morphemes\, etc.\, even if the
 y do not mean 'gender'\, can also acquire gendered meanings in specific in
 teractional contexts. This occurs through the association of non-gendered 
 linguistic means with stances/activities that are related to preferred ima
 ges of women/men in the broader sociocultural context. The theoretical und
 erpinnings of this position stem from Silverstein's (1976: 29) distinction
  between 'referential' and 'non-referential' indexes: the former have both
  semantic/referential and indexical/pragmatic meaning (and their referenti
 al value depends on their indexical value)\, while the latter have exclusi
 vely indexical meaning. Ochs contends that most indexing of gender is acco
 mplished non-referentially\, i.e. in a mediated way via stances\, social a
 ctions\, etc.\, rather than referentially\, i.e. in a direct and exclusive
  way.\n\nAs Hopper and Lebaron (1998: 60) remark\, though\, Ochs 'did not 
 provide a detailed analysis of talk in which speakers link details of talk
  to gendered roles'. Subsequent studies - not necessarily in a direct dial
 ogue with or in relationship to the 1992 paper - that looked\, more or les
 s explicitly\, at non-referential ways of indexing gender did rely on inte
 ractional analysis (cf. e.g. Beach and Glenn\, 2011\; Hopper and LeBaron\,
  1998\; Jackson\, 2011\; Land and Kitzinger\, 2011\; Stokoe\, 2012). For e
 xample\, Stockill and Kitzinger (2007) argue that even non-gendered terms\
 , e.g. people\, can become gendered in particular local interactional cont
 exts\, in other words\, 'the interactional meaning of gender is not intrin
 sic to gendered linguistic forms but to the action a linguistic form is us
 ed to do on any given occasion of use' (2007: 233). This\, in turn\, means
  that what is linguistically available as gendered is not necessarily inte
 ractionally gendered (Land and Kitzinger\, 2011) or\, to put it differentl
 y\, 'system relevance' does not ensure 'action relevance' (Klein\, 2011). 
 However\, to date there is no systematic and comprehensive discussion of t
 he non-referential aspects of gendering in interaction. \n\nThe purpose of
  the panel is\, then\, to explore such issues and flesh out what is involv
 ed in the non-referential indexing of gender across interactional contexts
 \, communities of practice\, languages and cultures. \n\nReferences:\n\nHo

DESCRIPTION:Generative grammar has made important contributions to our und
 erstanding of language\, and with it\, the human mind. The field continues
  to be fecund and vibrant and new discoveries and developments continue ap
 ace. However\, the rapid growth and development of this still-young field 
 leaves it without a clear and uncontroversial canon\, especially in syntax
 . There are few fundamental points that practitioners of the so-called min
 imalist approach have a clear consensus on. Because minimalist syntacticia
 ns generally cannot rely on a shared core of hypotheses and central princi
 ples\, each paper has to build its case from the ground up\, which results
  in publications steadily growing in size and presentations at conferences
  rarely generating the kind of excitement and fruitful discussion today th
 at they used to more than a decade ago. It has become increasingly difficu
 lt to prove individual analyses\, to prove them wrong\, or to confront the
 m in a meaningful way with counterarguments or supporting evidence.\n\nThi
 s conference represents a ‘reconstitutional’ meeting of major minds in
  generative syntax aimed at producing a white paper to (re)affirm the theo
 retical core\, work towards creating an analytical lingua franca\, and lay
  down a platform for research in the field in the coming years.\n\nIn addi
 tion to plenary and group discussions\, there will be a poster session\, i
 n which young and early-career-stage researchers will be encouraged to par
 ticipate. A formal call for papers for this session will be distributed vi
 a Linguist List in due time.\n\nInvited Contributors:\n\nElena Anagnostopo

DESCRIPTION:Following the era of decolonization\, many Caribbean authors h
 ave become internationally renowned and their works have been translated i
 nto major world languages. Consciously and unconsciously Caribbean works a
 re written expressions of creolization. A small number of academic journal
 s such as TTR and Palimpsestes have published important volumes dedicated 
 to translating the Caribbean region. This event aims both to build on the 
 mostly literary exposition in these volumes and to (re)focus specifically 
 on issues directly related to the translation of Caribbean Creole language
 s and cultures\, both within and beyond the realm of literary expression.'
   What are the inherent pitfalls in translating creolization? Can\, and sh
 ould\, the translation of creolization matter in a globalized world? To wh
 at extent can\, and how should\, Creole languages and cultures be translat
 ed?\n\nAs the field of Translation Studies rapidly expands\, issues relati
 ng to the translation of minority languages and cultures such as those of 
 the Caribbean have begun to receive more detailed attention. However\, som
 ething of a void still exists in regards to the translation of Caribbean C
 reole languages and cultures\, especially from regional academics. This sy
 mposium on “Translating Creolization” will therefore provide a forum f
 or airing new avenues of research and proposing new engagements in this ar
 ea for academics including post-graduate students in diverse interdiscipli
 nary fields such as Caribbean Studies\, Cultural Studies\, Post-colonial S
 tudies\, Diaspora Studies and translation theorists and practitioners. The
  main aim is to discuss the impact of theory on practice and vice versa as
  well as to exchange new theories and ideas on the issues specifically inv
 olved in translating Creole languages and cultures worldwide with a specia
 l focus on the Caribbean region.\n\nKeynote Speaker:\n\nProfessor Christin

DESCRIPTION:Panel on Language Learning and Sexuality at the 22nd Annual La
 vender Languages Conference\nLocation: Washington\, D.C.\, USA\nDates: Feb
 ruary 13–15\, 2015\nWebsite: http://www.american.edu/cas/anthropology/la
 vender-languages/\n\nCommitment:\n\nLav 22 offers discussions of language 
 and sexuality that draw on current debates in anthropological linguistics\
 , sociolinguistics\, sexuality studies\, and queer theory to examine diver
 se voices and experiences.\n\nAtmosphere:\n\nThe conference proudly mainta
 ins a 'no attitude' atmosphere. The conference setting is deliberately inf
 ormal. The program includes many opportunities for formal and informal dis
 cussion. Fees are deliberately suppressed to ensure that registration is a
 ffordable for the widest possible audience. Conference activities take pla
 ce in accessible sites. And\, with sufficient advance notice\, all events 
 have sign-language support. No one attending Lav 22 need feel alone\, out-
 of-place\, or unloved.\n\nProgram Planning:\n\nAlready there are several s
 essions under development with titles and contact details\, and session de
 scriptions will soon follow. Your ideas for a session or your plans for yo
 ur own\, individual paper are welcome\, of course. Contact the conference 
 coordinator for details.\n\nAbout the Choice of Conference Dates:\n\nLav 2
 1 had to be compressed (from 3 days to 2) owing to a snowstorm and its eff
 ects on air travel. We considered changing the conference dates to a time 
 later in the month or later in the spring. But truthfully\, any date we se
 lect before spring break will coincide with the possibility of snowfall. A
 nd any date after spring break coincides with someone's national or region
 al meetings. The plan is to try Valentine's weekend again\, hoping that sn
 owflakes won't strike twice in the same place two years in a row. If we ne
 ed to regroup on this policy after Lav 22\, we will.\n\nLogistics:\n\nInfo
 rmation about campus logistics and information on accommodations is posted
  elsewhere on the website. Please note that we will once again negotiate a
  block of hotel rooms at a site convenient to campus and at a reasonable w
 eekend rate. To confirm rooms at this rate\, conference participants are a
 sked to make reservations through the hotel website by mid-January. Detail
 s will be available at Accommodations.\n\nPlease message back (wlm@america
 n.edu) at any time if you have questions about the conference program or r
 elated logistics.\n\nWlm L. Leap\nConference Coordinator\nLavender Languag

  „Angemessenheit - pragmatische Perspektiven auf ein linguistisches Bewe
 rtungskriterium'\n\nOrganisiert von der Arbeitsgemeinschaft Linguistische 
 Pragmatik (ALP) e.V. \nDienstag\, den 03.03.2015 \nUniversität Leipzig\n\
 nSprachkritik entwickelt sich zunehmend zu einem „Hot Topic' innerhalb d
 er Linguistik. Reflektiert werden dabei sowohl Positionen von linguistisch
  ausgebildeten SprachkritikerInnen als auch von SprecherInnen ohne linguis
 tischen Wissenshintergrund. Die Letztgenannten werden in diesem Sinne als 
 Laien verstanden und ihre sprachkritischen Anmerkungen werden in der Forsc
 hung häufig unter dem Begriff der „Laiensprachkritik' zusammengefasst. 
 Für die deutschsprachige Sprachkritik gilt mittlerweile als erwiesen\, da
 ss sich die prototypisch vertretenen Positionen dieser beiden Gruppen grun
 dsätzlich unterscheiden. Zentrales Kriterium einer linguistisch basierten
  sprachkritischen Analyse bildet die pragmatische Angemessenheit\, die als
  ein Kontinuum aufgefasst wird und die intuitive\, binäre Sprachbewertung
  in „richtig' oder „falsch' ersetzen soll. Innerhalb der linguistische
 n Sprachkritik werden Stimmen lauter\, die fordern\, Angemessenheit als ei
 n komplexes\, kontextsensitives Beschreibungskriterium auch im Bildungsber
 eich (Schule\, Hochschule) zu etablieren (z. B. Kilian/Niehr/Schiewe 2010\
 , 2013\; Arendt/Kiesendahl 2011\, 2013). Wir sehen daher die Notwendigkeit
 \, das Konzept der Angemessenheit multiperspektivisch zu beleuchten und au
 f dieser Grundlage zu konturieren.\n\nWir gehen von folgenden Annahmen aus
 :\n\n1. Angemessenheit stellt ein zentrales Kriterium zur Beurteilung von 
 sprachlichem Handeln dar.\n2. Als normative Erwartung ist sie auch in dire
 kten Interaktionen nachweisbar.\n3. Empfundene (Un-)Angemessenheit hat Kon
 sequenzen für soziale Interaktion.\n4. Zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt bedarf das 
 Konzept der Angemessenheit einer ebenso theoretischen wie empirischen Fund
 ierung.

DESCRIPTION:The workshop 'Co- and Subordination in German and Other Langua
 ges' (AG 5) is organised as part of the 37. Jahrestagung der Deutschen Ges
 ellschaft für Sprachwissenschaft / Annual Conference of the German Lingui
 stic Society (DGfS) 'Grammatische Modellierung und sprachliche Verschieden
 heit'\, to be held at the University of Leipzig\, Germany\, March 4-6\, 20
 15. \n\nInvited Speakers:\n\nMarga Reis (Universität Tübingen)\nMarkus S
 teinbach / Mailin Antomo (Universität Göttingen)\n\nIn recent years\, re
 search on coordination and subordination saw a lively debate and substanti
 al empirical progress in the field of non-canonical complex sentences. In 
 particular alternating constructions like weil-V-final vs. weil-V2\,  obwo
 hl-V-final vs. obwohl-V2\, V-final vs. V1-conditionals \, V-final vs. V2-r
 elatives  symmetric vs. asymmetric coordination or standard vs. pseudo-con
 ditionals have been in the focus of recent research. This empirical progre
 ss is well documented in recent collections like Ehrich et al. (2009) and 
 Meibauer et al. (2013).\n \nWhile empirical progress was in fact substanti
 al\, the theoretical concepts to model those properties are still rather p
 oorly understood and somewhat vague. From a semantic point of view\, for e
 xample\, the concept of assertoric force that is often taken to correlate 
 with V2-alternatives needs to be sharpened and delineated from other relev
 ant concepts like presupposition or backgrounding.  And from a syntactic p
 oint of view\, it is still rather unclear how to precisely model the diffe
 rent kinds of non-canonical complex sentences. Even though first steps hav
 e been undertaken\, it seems promising to us to start from recent empirica
 l discussions and contrast precise analyses in different frameworks like m
 inimalism\, HPSG\, LFG\, construction grammar etc.\n \nWhen thinking about
  alternating constructions\, one question that needs to be addressed is ho
 w this alternation came about. Has one alternative emerged from the other?
  If so\, what are the reasons for that? Is the functional differentiation 
 a trigger or a consequence of the emergence of alternatives? This is parti
 cularly interesting in the ongoing debate about the emergence of hypotacti
 c structures out of paratactic structures and the alleged reverse developm
 ent of the loss of hypotactic structures.\n  \nAlso\, recent research show
 ed a strong focus on German data. In this AG\, however\, we would like to 
 widen the perspective and to ask\, to what extent other languages show com
 parable variation\, comparable alternating constructions\, and whether the
 se constructions show similar syntactic\, semantic and pragmatic behavior.
  We invite typological as well as diachronic papers\, and are also interes
 ted in questions of L1 acquisition.\n \nA final question we want to discus
 s in this AG concerns the use of such constructions rather than their theo
 retic modeling or typological variation: Why do languages provide alternat
 ing constructions to begin with? Do they in fact differ in their (pragmati
 c) functionality? Or do we have to take psycholinguistic considerations in
 to account like the processing of old and new information or the 'uniform 
 information density hypothesis'?\n\nReferences:\n\nEhrich et al. (Hgg.) (2

DESCRIPTION:Interpersonal Pragmatics of Social Interaction in Chinese\n\nI
 t is well established that research on Chinese language needs to be given 
 increasing attention due to the growth in political\, economic and cultura
 l interactions between Chinese speakers and speakers of other languages. T
 here have been numerous studies of social interactions in English and othe
 r languages\, but a limited amount of research on social interactions in C
 hinese to date. Building on the panels on Chinese discourse and interactio
 n and identity as resource in Chinese discourse that were held at the 11th
  and 12th International Pragmatics conferences respectively\, this panel w
 ill focus on the issues of interpersonal pragmatics\, including im/politen
 ess\, affiliation/disafiliation\, face\, humour\, social practices and so 
 on\, specifically drawing on interactional data arising in either institut
 ional and non-institutional settings. The aim of this panel is to bring to
 gether scholars who work in this area to explore and discuss the ways in w
 hich the Chinese speakers manifest themselves in their interpersonal pract
 ices in interactional settings. The hope is thus to gain comprehensive\, s
 ocio-cultural insights into the pragmatics of Chinese interpersonal intera
 ctions.

SUMMARY:Substance and Structure in Linguistics
DTSTART;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20150227T000000
DTEND;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20150228T000000
UID:http://linguistlist.org/issues/25/25-2697.html
DESCRIPTION:For the old structuralists (especially the European variety)\,
  the distinction between substance and structure (or form) served two impo
 rtant purposes: 1) It provided a means for simultaneously allowing for lan
 guage-particular and universal aspects of language: structural properties 
 were seen as language-particular modulations of substance\, which was take
 n to be at least potentially universal. 2) It made possible a definition o
 f linguistics as an autonomous discipline dealing with an area of phenomen
 a that are specifically properties of languages: according to structuralis
 m\, structure were taken to be the central concern of linguists\, rather t
 han substance.\n\nFrom the beginning\, then\, substance played a marginal 
 role in 20th century linguistics\, and with the fading of structuralist fr
 ameworks and the rise and increasing dominance of generative grammar\, the
  distinction between substance and structure fell into almost complete obl
 ivion. The idea of Universal Grammar and thus universal linguistic structu
 re left little need and room for substance in the theory.\n\nStill\, the d
 istinction between structure and substance was not entirely forgotten. It 
 lived on in some individual linguists and scholarly environments that did 
 not follow the Chomskyan way\, and did not reject structuralist ideas en b
 loc. As one example\, Danish Functional Linguistics (cf. Engberg-Pedersen 
 & al. 1996) adopted (in modified form) Hjelmslev’s version of the distin
 ction\, and in this community it continues to play a central role (especia
 lly\, Harder 1996). Other examples are found in linguistic typology\, wher
 e Gilbert Lazard has stressed the importance of distinguishing between str
 ucture and substance (e.g. Lazard 2005)\, and Bybee has discussed grammati
 calization and semantic change in terms of the distinction (e.g.  Bybee 19
 88).\n\nRecent years have witnessed a revitalization of the distinction wi
 thin functional typology and cognitive linguistics. Haspelmath has explici
 tly invoked the notion of substance in his discussions of the basis of cro
 sslinguistic comparison and categorization (e.g. Haspelmath 2010)\, and Cr
 oft has used a similar notion\, conceptual space\, to point out the common
  ground of semantic mapping and multidimensional scaling (e.g. Croft 2003)
 . In connection with the issue of linguistic relativity\, Slobin’s work 
 on ‘Thinking for Speaking’ (e.g. Slobin 1996) may be seen as an argume
 nt that it is not a one-way issue of substance constraining structure – 
 the way we form substance for the purpose of linguistic formulation may ha
 ve an impact on the conceptual substance itself\, i.e. on how speakers con
 ceptualize the world around them. In a similar vein\, Levinson (2003) make
 s a distinction between semantic structure (language-particular) and conce
 ptual structure (potentially universal)\, and simultaneously argues that t
 here is an interface between the two. All these scholars – including tho
 se affiliated with Danish Functional Linguistics – seem to converge in s
 tressing the importance of the structuralist distinction between substance
  and structure\, while at the same diverging from the old structuralists b
 y including substance in the focus of linguistics. \n\nThe aim of this wor
 kshop is to discuss the distinction between substance and structure itself
  and linguistic phenomena and problems that can fruitfully be approached i
 n terms of the distinction.\n\nSee full description at: http://inss.ku.dk/

DESCRIPTION:The « Textes et Cultures » Research Centre at the Universit
 é d’Artois (Arras\, France) is pleased to invite papers for its interna
 tional conference\, “Here and Elsewhere in Translated Literature\,” to
  be held on May 21-22\, 2015.\n\nThe aim of this conference is to explore 
 how the Elsewhere is depicted in translated literature (what sort of image
 s are represented\, how and why they are altered in the target text\, etc.
 ) as well as the role of translation in the transfer of images across cult
 ures\, bearing in mind that the concept of “images” is a multifaceted 
 one\, since it can be understood as the way a culture is represented or ca
 n be linked to imagery\, figures of speech or metaphors.\n\nLiterature is 
 first and foremost a place where writers and readers meet on various level
 s—involving language\, emotions\, imagery and imagination. Through trans
 lation\, literature may aspire to be the link between the writer and the u
 niversal reader. Images conveyed in literary works Here may succeed in tak
 ing on an aspect related to Elsewhere. The aim of this conference is to ex
 plore how the Elsewhere is depicted in translated literature as well as th
 e role of translation in the transfer of images across cultures. The conce
 pt of “images” is a multifaceted one:\n\n- On the one hand it may refe
 r to the way a culture is represented. What sort of images from Elsewhere 
 are represented in translated literature? Are they identical to the ones u
 sed in the original works? Is there a cultural and social influence on the
  way these images are altered? Besides\, on the reception side\, how are t
 ranslated images perceived by the reader? To what extent does translation 
 contribute to or hinder transcultural exchanges?\n\n- On the other hand th
 ere can be a more stylistic approach\, if “image” is linked to imagery
 \, figures of speech or metaphors. What becomes of imagery in translated w
 orks? How are literary metaphors conveyed across different cultures? Shoul
 d the Foreign\, the Other\, the imagery from Elsewhere be kept\, or should
  it be domesticated to fit the culture prevailing Here? Contributors may a
 ddress translation difficulties\, successes or failures.

SUMMARY:Social Dynamics of Pronominal Systems

DESCRIPTION:The purpose of this session is to propose a socio-semiotic ana
 lysis of pronominal systems from the pragmatic point of view of sociality\
 , spatial semiotics\, and the bio-semiotics of territoriality. Personal pr
 onouns\, for instance\, are used to determine closeness or distance\, domi
 nance or submission\, equality or inequality\, gender\, absolute and relat
 ive status. This raises the issue of the role of pronominal systems in the
  early development of the child’s identity. Moreover\, the social dynami
 c generated by pronominal systems necessarily impacts the interface betwee
 n languages and creates zones of friction and misunderstandings. A better 
 awareness of the relative implications of these systems should improve int
 er-ethnic and inter-linguistic interactions. In most languages\, personal 
 pronouns form a relatively autonomous system which not only regulates but 
 also constitutes the form of social relationships among speakers of these 
 languages. These systems change with time and space under a variety of con
 straints. In the meta-language of pedagogical discourse\, pronouns are def
 ined as indexical tools\, that is\, abstract relational tools which need a
  context to receive some content. The use of pronominal systems is not onl
 y regulated by syntactic rules but also governed by pragmatic norms. Howev
 er\, all languages do not offer the same systematic pronominal resources t
 o their speakers. When history and socio-politics bring speakers of differ
 ent languages into contact\, their respective pronominal systems rarely ma
 p exactly unto each other. This often causes the emergence of tensions whi
 ch are generated by the lack of homology between the pronominal systems co
 ncerned and their pragmatic rules.

DESCRIPTION:Our session seeks to collect\, compare\, and verify the validi
 ty of different methodological practical experiences in current research o
 n prosody. Due to this focus\, many questions will arise. One important qu
 estion will be how to choose the optimal procedure for collecting adequate
  data. This is a difficult question since many contextual factors (e.g. la
 nguage contact\, L2\, information structure) can influence prosodic realiz
 ation. Questions will also arise about the adequacy of a specific method\,
  since different methods produce different results.\n\nThe invited speaker

DESCRIPTION:The 27th North American Conference on Chinese Linguistics (NAC
 CL-27) will be held at the University of California\, Los Angeles\, April 
 3-5\, 2015.\n\nThe theme of the conference will be Integrating Chinese Lin
 guistic Research with Language Teaching. Linguistic research and language 
 teaching have generally been viewed as two separate types of academic ende
 avors\, each with its own priorities and practices. While linguists have b
 een preoccupied with uncovering patterns of language and building theories
  of language structure\, rarely are they concerned with issues in language
  pedagogy. Language teaching practitioners\, on the other hand\, often enc
 ounter teaching and learning issues that are not readily addressed by theo
 retical linguistic research and find themselves in need of enriching their
  knowledge about the language for a better-informed pedagogy. We believe t
 hat it is time now that the integration of the two strands of academic end
 eavors be prioritized\, for a number of reasons: a) truly insightful lingu
 istic findings should find their value in applications such as language te
 aching\, b) it takes tremendous effort and time to translate research into
  practical language teaching\, c) language teaching can raise fundamental 
 questions for linguistic research\, and finally\, d) the proliferation of 
 Chinese language learning and teaching at the global level demands increas
 ed linguistic effort and synergy for a deeper understanding of the languag
 e and better pedagogies for language teaching.\n\nA pre-conference worksho
 p for language teachers is being planned. Stay tuned as more information b
 ecomes available.

DESCRIPTION:The Semantics\, Pragmatics\, and Metapragmatics of Discourse C
 onnectives\, Markers\, and Particles in Variable Contexts\n \n14th Interna
 tional Pragmatics Conference\, Antwerp\, Belgium\, 26-31 July 2015\n\nThe 
 past two decades have seen an explosion of research on the use of linguist
 ic expressions\, referred to using various terms\, including discourse 'ma
 rker'\, 'connective'\, and 'particle' (Jucker and Ziv 1998:1). Moreover\, 
 Fischer (2006:1) observes that '…the approaches vary with respect to ver
 y many different aspects: …the terminology used\, the functions consider
 ed\, the problems focused on\, and the methodologies employed.'\n \nThis p
 anel aims to bring together scholars who examine the use of these 'pragmat
 ic markers' (cf. Aijmer 2013)\, taking into account how variation in their
  use can be explained by factors such as (but not limited to) text type\, 
 activity type\, discourse context\, speakers (e.g. their social and cultur
 al background\, assumptions\, dialect\, language\, language proficiency)\,
  and their discourse-pragmatic functions. Adopting Aijmer's focus\, our ob
 jective 'is to go beyond a concern with sociolinguistic categories such as
  age and gender' (2013:2)\, in order to account for variation in the use o
 f these linguistic expressions in different discourse contexts. A more gen
 eral goal of this panel is to gain a better understanding of the 'multifun
 ctionality' of pragmatic markers (i.e. discourse markers\, connectives\, o
 r particles) and to provide an empirically based account of their meanings
  on the semantic and pragmatic levels. Papers submitted for this panel may
  adopt different theoretical frameworks of analysis (e.g. Gricean or neo-G
 ricean\, Relevance Theory\, Discourse Analysis\, Argumentation Theory\, et
 c.).\n\nReferences:\n\nAijmer\, Karin. 2013. Understanding Pragmatic Marke

DESCRIPTION:‘Tell me all about it’: Interactional dynamics in research
  interviews\nValerie Williams\, Kathryn Roulston\n\nConversation analysis 
 addresses itself to the ‘mundane’ in everyday talk\, and has taken pai
 ns to unpick the regularities in naturally occurring data\, distinguishing
  that from the contrived data in research interviews. However\, from the s
 tart of the CA project there has been a parallel interest in analysing the
  research interview as a site of active meaning making (Baker\, 1997\; Sil
 verman\, 1973\; Williams\, 2011\; see Roulston\, 2006 for an overview). As
  van den Berg et al (2001: 1) put it: ‘The empirical data of social rese
 arch are predominantly products of specific discursive practices’. Some 
 CA analysis has addressed itself to the troubles in structured\, survey-ty
 pe interviews (Suchman & Jordan\, 1990\; Antaki et al.\, 2002). By contras
 t\, much of the in-depth qualitative interviewing that describes itself as
  ‘semi-structured’ or narrative\, aims to open up and listen to the pa
 rticipant on their own terms. As Widdicombe and Wooffitt (2006) suggest\, 
 much of what goes on in a research interview depends on the tacit understa
 nding each participant has of the expectations on them to ask and answer q
 uestions.

DESCRIPTION:Das Konzept der Normalität spielt in vielen Bereichen der Spr
 ache eine\nzentrale Rolle. Ein möglicher Grund dafür ist\, dass Annahmen
  über\nNormalität – Normalerwartungen oder Normalvorstellungen – die
  Komplexität\nsprachlichen Handelns reduzieren und damit Kommunikation ve
 reinfachen bzw.\nerst ermöglichen: Bestimmte Ereignisse sind erwartbarer 
 als andere\, sie\n„verstehen sich von selbst“ und müssen nicht sprach
 lich verhandelt werden.\nUnter Bezug auf Konzepte wie Default\, Salienz\, 
 Präferenz\, Common Ground\,\nStereotyp\, Prototyp oder Frame\, die alle i
 n unterschiedlicher Form auf die\nKategorie der Normalität rekurrieren\, 
 wurden Phänomene der Syntax (z.B.\nnormale Wortfolge\, Default-Reihenfolg
 e bei Argument Linking)\, der Semantik\n(z.B. generische Sätze\, präferi
 erte Lesarten) und der Pragmatik (z.B.\nImplikaturen\, Frage-Antwort-Paare
 \, Normalkontext) zu erfassen versucht.\nTrotzdem gibt es bisher keine koh
 ärente linguistische Theorie der\nNormalität. Z.B. nutzt man ein Konzept
  von Default für die Analyse von\nskalaren Impikaturen (Einige Schüler w
 aren pünktlich. +> Nicht alle Schüler\nwaren pünktlich.). Neo-Grice’s
 che Analysen gehen davon aus\, dass die\nImplikatur ‚nicht alle‘ norma
 lerweise\, d.h. in Abwesenheit von speziellen\nUmständen\, mit dem Ausdru
 ck einige assoziiert wird. Geurts (2010:93) weist\nnun allerdings darauf h
 in\, dass „authors who claim that implicatures are\ndefaults […] almos
 t never endeavour to explain why”. Darüber hinaus gibt es\neine Vielzah
 l sprachlicher Ausdruckstypen\, bei deren Analyse man vermutlich\nauf ein 
 Konzept von Normalerwartungen von Sprecher und/oder Hörer zugreifen\nmuss
 \, z.B. konzessive Konstruktionen\, Exklamative. Solche Ausdruckstypen\nwe
 rfen die Frage auf\, welchen Status Normalerwartungen von Sprechern in\nei
 ner linguistischen Theorie haben sollen. Ziel der AG ist es\,\nLinguist/in
 n/en zusammenzuführen\, die sich aus verschiedenen Perspektiven\nmit Phä
 nomenen linguistischer Normalität und Normalerwartung beschäftigen\,\num
  so die vorhandene Forschung in diesem Bereich zu bündeln und neue\nPersp

DESCRIPTION:The overarching topic of this panel is untruthfulness\, specif
 ically communicating what the speaker believes to be untrue/false\, which 
 may be overt or covert from the hearer’s perspective. Overt untruthfulne
 ss shows in utterances to whose content the speaker does not subscribe\, w
 hich the hearer is meant to recognise in order to infer implicit meanings\
 , as is the case with irony. On the other hand\, covert untruthfulness enc
 ompasses communicative strategies orientated towards deceiving the hearer 
 and rests on the latter’s not acknowledging the speaker’s explicit or 
 implicit communication of false beliefs.\n \nBoth irony and deception have
  garnered a lot of scholarly attention\, but numerous problems are yet to 
 be resolved. Each of these notions invites numerous definitional and class
 ificatory problems. According to the well-entrenched classical definition\
 , in irony\, the intended meaning is opposite to the literal one. However\
 , irony shows numerous manifestations which necessitate considerable refor
 mulations\, if not rejection\, of the standard view. The mechanism of nega
 tion/opposition not only shows many subtypes but also is not always in ope
 ration. On the other hand\, deception may be defined as causing the hearer
  (to continue) to hold a belief which the speaker believes to be false. It
  shows numerous manifestations\, both verbal and non-verbal\, each of whic
 h gives rise to many discussions on its underlying mechanisms and intrinsi
 c characteristics.

 IS to be held at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais from 7-10 July\, 201
 5\n\nConvenors: Kerstin Kunz\, Ekaterina Lapshinova-Koltunski and Katrin M
 enzel\n\nThe panel will investigate textual relations of cohesion and cohe
 rence in translation and multilingual text production with a strong focus 
 on innovative methods of empirical analysis\, as well as technology and co
 mputation. Given the amount of multilingual computation that is taking pla
 ce\, this topic is important for both human and machine translation\, and 
 further multilingual studies.\n\nSelected papers will be published in the 
 special book series 'Translation and Multilingual Natural Language Process
 ing' edited by Reinhard Rapp\, Silvia Hansen-Schirra and Oliver Čulo (see
  http://langsci-press.org/catalog/series/TMNLP)to appear in 2015.\n\nCohes
 ion refers to the text-internal relationship of linguistic elements that a
 re overtly linked via lexical and grammatical devices across sentence boun
 daries to be understood as a text (Halliday/Hasan 1976:2-4\, Widdowson 197
 9:87). The recognition of coherence in a text is more subjective as it inv
 olves text- and reader-based features and refers to the logical flow of in
 terrelated ideas in a text\, thus establishing a mental textual world (cf.
  Crystal 2008:85\, Widdowson 1979:312). There is a connection between thes
 e two concepts in that relations of cohesion can be regarded as explicit i
 ndicators of meaning relations in a text and\, hence\, contribute to its o
 verall coherence.\n\nThe aim of this panel is to bring together scholars a
 nalyzing cohesion and coherence from different research perspectives that 
 cover translation-relevant topics: language contrast\, translationese and 
 machine translation. What these approaches share is that they investigate 
 instantiations of discourse phenomena in a multilingual context. And moreo
 ver\, language comparison is based on empirical data. The challenges here 
 can be identified with respect to the following methodological questions:\
 n\n1. How to arrive at a cost-effective operationalization of the annotati
 on process when dealing with a broader range of discourse phenomena?\n\n2.
  Which statistical techniques are needed and are adequate for the analysis
 ? And which methods can be combined for data interpretation?\n\n3. Which a
 pplications of the knowledge acquired are possible in multilingual computa
 tion\, especially in machine translation?\n\nFor the list of references pl

DESCRIPTION:Some institutions (the police\, social services\, the medical

 o are vulnerable in terms of their emotional circumstances\, their intelle
 ctual or bodily abilities\, their physical frailty\, or other challenges t
 o their ability to cope. Such troubles may elicit empathy\; but institutio
 ns vary greatly in the degree of empathy they allow their front-line staff
  to provide.  At one extreme is the supportive helpline which gives free r
 ein to callers' expression of their troubles\; at the other extreme is the
  judicial enquiry which must proceed on strictly factual terms. There is a
  constant tension between respecting the clients' accounts\, feelings and 
 experiences on the one hand\, and proceeding with institutional objectives
  in the other.\n\nThe Conversation Analysis research that this Panel repor
 ts reveals the commonalities (and the differences) by which very various i
 nstitutional practitioners handle the tension of their institutional requi
 rements and deal with the distress and confusion that  their clients often
  express.

DESCRIPTION:Complex linguistic repertoires and minority languages in immig
 rant communities\nFrancesco Goglia\, Susana Afonso\n\nThe complex linguist
 ic repertoire of some immigrant communities may include a recognised or no
 n-recognised minority language in their country of origin. In the immigrat
 ion context\, minority languages will face the traditional competition wit
 h the majority language of the country of origin and the one from the lang
 uage(s) of the host country. The maintenance of the minority immigrant lan
 guage(s) is even more difficult than the one of the majority immigrant lan
 guage(s) and depends on a series of factors such as ethnic and religious i
 dentities\, nationalism\, group and personal allegiances to the language a
 s well as the chance to use such languages in the immigration context. In 
 some cases\, language use and choice in the immigration context may be str
 ictly linked to issues of changes in language policy and language use in t
 he country of origin. Moroccan immigrants in France\, Italy and Spain also
  speak Berber which has gained\, in the recent years\, official status in 
 Morocco (Jilali\, 2001). Members of the Cape Verdean community in the USA 
 actively promote Cape Verdean Creole within the community by establishing 
 bilingual (Creole-English) schools (Rego\, 2010)\, the de facto language b
 ut not yet co-official with Portuguese in Cabo Verde. These individuals ta
 ke part in the decision making in Cabo Verde regarding the standardisation
  and officialisation of the Creole in the country. East-Timorese immigrant
 s in Portugal use Tetum\, now co-official language with Portuguese in East
 -Timor\, to flag their national identity (Goglia and Afonso\, 2012). In so
 me cases\, minority languages in the diaspora are strong markers of ethnic
  groups or stateless nations. Igbo immigrants in Italy\, Australia and the
  UK regard the Igbo language as an important marker of their ethnic identi
 ty (Goglia\, 2011).

DESCRIPTION:The Pragmatics of Tourist Communication - Strategies of Adapta
 tion\n\nAs one of the most influential branches of global economy\, touris
 m is established and maintained by an overwhelming amount of communication
  practises\, which have not yet been in the focus of linguistic research. 
 Apart from some studies in the discourse analytical perspective (cf. Thurl
 ow/Jaworski 2010)\, neither the increasing variety of text genres often pr
 oduced in multimodal dimensions nor the different strategies of representa
 tion and promotion of places as destinations have systematically attracted
  the attention of linguists.\n\nBeing discursive in nature\, however\, the
  tourist industry is continuously creating and differentiating a cross-med
 ial and mostly promotional text culture\, which connects continents\, cult
 ures and people. It virtually moves the world\, triggering multiple proces
 ses of transformation\, so that a remote place is perceived as home\, natu
 ral circumstances become special attractions\, persons are presented as ho
 sts or visitors\; authentic identities and routines turn into extraordinar
 y goods in a global event market\, where vacation and travel function as d
 esired consumption products.

SUMMARY:Bilingualism and Cognitive Aging

DESCRIPTION:Recent years have seen a host of studies on the topic of langu
 age and cognitive control in bilingualism. Featuring prominently in this n
 ow quite rich literature is the so-called cognitive control advantage\; no
 w found in abundance are studies presenting converging (and diverging) evi
 dence that bilinguals outperform monolinguals on working memory capacity a
 nd executive functioning tasks. What has been relatively underresearched t
 hese past few years is how all of this pertains to aging bilinguals. This 
 caveat is counterintuitive\, given that one of the most notable findings t
 hat sparked the bulk of research into the cognitive advantage of bilingual
 s was that older bilinguals do not suffer as much from the age-related cog
 nitive decline found in their monolinguals peers – even to the extent th
 at the onset of degenerate diseases like dementia takes place 4 years late
 r\, on average\, in bilinguals (Bialystok et al.\, 2004). \n\nPerhaps now 
 more than ever is the time to unravel the details underlying cognitive agi
 ng in bilinguals. Due to increased life expectancies and reduced birth rat
 es\, developed countries now see large numbers of older adults (Alho\, 200
 8). As a result of international mobility\, a substantial number of these 
 elderly populations are multilingual. When zooming in on bilingualism and 
 cognitive aging\, it is important that the issue of language proficiency i
 n both languages is addressed\, which has often been overlooked in the pas
 t. Substantial individual variation is likely to characterize different gr
 oups of migrants and truly balanced bilinguals make up only a small propor
 tion of the population of older bilinguals in any given country. Moreover\
 , most previous work on language and cognitive aging in bilingual contexts
  has focused on early simultaneous bilinguals\, as opposed to late sequent
 ial bilinguals that make up the bulk of migrant communities. In other word
 s\, it is  important to detail the language use patterns as well as langua
 ge proficiency and\, crucially\, language attrition patterns (both of the 
 first and second language) of these speakers as they age\, as these proces
 ses may all greatly impact on the cognitive and language control of indivi
 dual bilingual older adults.\n\nThe main aim of this conference is to brin
 g together researchers working on bilingualism and aging\, both those appl
 ying behavioral and neuroimaging techniques to their data sets\, and who m
 ay come from different but related fields such as psychology\, linguistics
  or neuroscience. In a single-session format\, key topics in the exciting 
 field of language and cognitive control in older bilinguals are addressed 
 and revisited to establish the current state-of-the-art in this field. \n\

SUMMARY:DGfS 2015 Workshop: Varieties of Positive Polarity Items
DTSTART;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20150304T000000
DTEND;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20150306T000000
UID:http://linguistlist.org/issues/25/25-2668.html
DESCRIPTION:In the past\, the rich literature on polarity sensitivity most
 ly focused on negative polarity items (NPIs)\; positive polarity items (PP
 Is) were believed to be less impressive in number\, productivity\, and str
 ength (Horn 1989:157). Recent literature\, however\, shows that PPIs are e
 mpirically just as robust as NPIs and raise theoretically intriguing quest
 ions at the interfaces between syntax\, semantics and pragmatics. In this 
 workshop\, we seek to bring to discussion questions about:\n\n1) Language-
 specific and cross-linguistic varieties of PPIs\n2) Their formal modeling 
 in different theoretical frameworks\n\nPositive polarity is known to be hi
 ghly language-dependent. Speaker-oriented adverbs such as unfortunately/le
 ider act as PPIs in English and German\, but their Czech correspondents do
  not (Junghanns 2006). Similarly\, Zeijlstra (2013) argues that\, unlike i
 n English\, the universal quantifier iedereen 'everybody' in Dutch is a PP
 I. This diversity challenges the plausibility of a unified account of posi
 tive polarity. One of the main theoretical debates in this respect concern
 s the nature of PPIs in relation to the better-studied NPIs. In Szabolcsi 
 (2004)\, for instance\, anti-additivity is as important for PPIs as downwa
 rd entailment for NPIs. Another concern is the relevance of notions such a
 s scalarity and scope to the modeling of PPIs within and across individual
  languages. Nilsen (2004) and Sawada (2011) analyze PPI modal adverbs like
  probably and Japanese minimizer PPIs like chotto/sukoshi 'a bit' by means
  of scales\, but others propose alternate non-scalar approaches (e.g.\, Er
 nst 2009\, Giannakidou 2011\, Liu 2012\, Iatridou & Zeijlstra 2013\, Homer
  t.a.). While most PPIs can outscope negation\, a promising research quest
 ion relates to PPIs that ban negation altogether (see German *schon nicht 
 / *nicht schon\, Löbner 1999) and their modeling by comparison to inverse
 ly licensed NPIs (see Korean amwu-to 'anyone' in Sells & Kim 2006).\n\nOur
  workshop will provide the ideal platform for such empirical and theoretic
 al discussions\, but also for experimental (see Saddy et al. 2004\, Vasish
 th et al. 2008\, Yurchenko et al. 2012)\, diachronic and computational\nst
 udies towards a better understanding of polarity in natural language. \n\n

DESCRIPTION:How to do things with films: The pragmatics of telecinematic d
 iscourse\nIPRA 14 (Antwerp 2015)\n\nProf. Dr. Wolfram Bublitz (University 
 of Augsburg\, Germany) \nDr. Christian R. Hoffmann (University of Augsburg
 \, Germany)\n\nIn the last decade\, telecinematic discourse has become one
  of the most promising avenues of research in media pragmatics. What makes
  telecinematic discourse an exciting new arena for pragmatics is the compl
 ex interplay between those who create film (directors\, producers\, etc.)\
 , those who enact it (actors) and those who watch it (audience). A pragmat
 ic investigation of telecinematic discourse thus needs to account for how 
 directors attempt to constrain potential interpretations of their work thr
 ough a careful orchestration of audiovisual cues\, temporally unfolding sh
 ots and varying audience expectations.\n\nWhile previous pragmatic studies
  have largely focused on language in films (Quaglio 2009\, Bednarek 2010\,
  Richardson 2010\, Rossi 2011)\, more recent papers have called for a more
  specialised pragmatics of film\, which sets out to explore the pragmatic 
 codes of cinematic expression\, e.g. camera work\, lighting\, scoring\, mo
 ntage\, mise-en-scène\, etc. (cf. Janney 2013).\n\nTo this end\, we invit
 e papers presenting current developments in either one of the two aforemen
 tioned lines of research\, serving a twofold objective: on the one hand\, 
 we wish to explore more thoroughly the pragmatic dimension of verbal langu
 age (e.g. dialogues\, monologues) as well as its interplay with other semi
 otic modes of expression (e.g. sound\, music\, etc.) in both contemporary 
 (synchronic approaches) and past films (diachronic approaches). On the oth
 er hand\, we aim to investigate how telecinematic discourse challenges the
  methodological feasibility of well-established pragmatic methods and theo
 ries\, e.g. Searle's speech act theory\, Grice's maxims of conversation\, 
 presuppositions and implicatures\, etc. \n\nIn asking if and how pragmatic
 s needs to adapt to the analysis of moving images\, we pay tribute to the 
 general theme of the conference\, i.e. adaptability. Presentations will sh
 ow how language manifests itself in film as a malleable phenomenon both in
  relation to other semiotic sign systems as well as other cinematic techni
 ques of (re-)presentation. If anything\, the panel will show that in telec
 inematic discourse\, the classic distinction between verbal language and i
 ts enveloping context is no longer tenable. In contrast\, language in film
 s is intrinsically tied to other co-occurring modes of expression which co
 llectively trigger pragmatic inferences.

SUMMARY:Use of Parallel Texts as an Approach to Metaphor Variation across

DESCRIPTION:We propose a theme session at The First International Conferen
 ce of Cultural Linguistics (21-22 July 2016\, Prato\, Tuscany\, Italy) tha
 t addresses the usefulness of parallel texts in studying metaphor variatio
 n across languages and cultures. This session is expected to help define c
 ultural linguistics as a multi-disciplinary field by attracting scholars i
 n contrastive linguistics\, cognitive linguistics\, linguistic typology\, 
 corpus linguistics\, stylistics\, translation\, and literary studies. In a
 ddition\, by proposing the session\, we hope to introduce a new but useful
  research methodology to cultural linguistics.\n\nThe role of cultural con
 text has been extensively recognized in metaphor studies. Different langua
 ges and cultures provide their users with different socio-cultural environ
 ments\, with which the speakers understand\, conceptualize and interact wi
 th the world around them. Accordingly\, the metaphor (or the source concep
 t) that different languages and cultures may utilize in talking about the 
 same event is bound to vary.\n\nPast research on the variation of metaphor
  has been methodologically based on use of introspection\, mono-lingual co
 rpora and experimental methods. However\, as language production is heavil
 y influenced by all sorts of context\, there has been no way of studying t
 he interaction of culture and metaphor by controlling for the same linguis
 tic\, physical and social context\, while keeping the language production 
 contextualized. In view of this problem\, we believe that use of parallel 
 texts (translations) constitute an efficient methodological opportunity fo
 r studying metaphor across languages and cultures in a contextualized way
 — If we see the author and the translator(s) as sensible text producers\
 , then by keeping the same most other contextual factors\, including lingu
 istic\, physical\, social context\, production mode and genre\, researcher
 s are allowed to empirically study the role played by the cultural context
  in metaphor use in stretches of discourse where all text producers try to
  get across highly similar (if not identical) messages. However\, use of p
 arallel texts (or translation) in studying metaphor has not received much 
 attention\, with only few exceptions (Rojo and Ibarretxe-Antuñano 2013\; 
 Tabakowska 1993\; Chapter 7 in Kövecses 2005). \n\nTherefore\, the theme 
 session is proposed to systematically take advantage of the methodology in
  cultural linguistics\, in order to test what can be done with parallel te
 xts in metaphor studies across languages and cultures.\n\nWe invite propos
 als of roughly 300 words (excluding references) for theme session presenta
 tions. If interested\, please send your proposal to Dr. Wei-lun Lu (weilun
 lu AT gmail DOT com) by 9 October. Notification of selection will be commu
 nicated by 15 October. In your submission\, please kindly also provide you

  Linguistics Research Group wishes to gather researchers from various theo
 retical frameworks in linguistics\, to focus on the making of meaning whic
 h results from the interaction of linguistic “markers” and “structur
 es.''\n\nThis conference will adopt a purely linguistic approach to these 
 phenomena (grammar\, morphology\, syntax\, semantics\, cognition\, prosody
 \, discourse) and all analyses should be based on authentic corpora. Those
  submissions which take into account the interfaces between these differen
 t dimensions of language will be favoured.\n\nFor example\, in English\, h
 ow can have and get be systematized within their syntactic environments? T
 he question can be extended to negative structures\, the passive\, or do +
  pronouns. Likewise\, how is the meaning of should filtered in context by 
 the fact that it appears in a complement clause after extraposition which 
 construes judgment (it’s nice that he should have come) as opposed to a 
 complement clause within a jussive main clause (He ordered that the hostag
 es should be freed)? Or\, how is the meaning of since determined\, dependi
 ng on whether it co-occurs with a present or present perfect in the main c
 lause?\n\nThis line of enquiry will be underpinned by a definition of cert
 ain concepts\, and by specifying what is meant by terms such as “marker\
 ,” “collocation\,” “structure\,” “construction\,” “colliga
 tion” or “pattern\,'' to quote just a few. To what extent are the cons
 tructions under study more or less constrained? How are certain adjustment
 s in meaning\, ambiguity or misunderstanding possible? (e.g. Tu me remets 
 en prison\, je suis fini). Moreover\, how relevant is the term “instanti
 ation\,” which suggests a static model based on “filling” positions 
 or “slots”? Is the distinction between grammatical and lexical items p
 ertinent here? (cf. work on French by de Vogüé 2004\, on fil\, by Legall
 ois 2012 on colligations\, by de Vogüé and Paillard (1997)\, or by Bolly
  2012 on prendre (prendre racine\, prendre vie\, prendre la vie de quelqu
 ’un)). Can prosody also be regarded as a “marker”? Is it appropriate
  to talk about “complex markers”\, the trace of a unique operation? Ho
 w are chains of operations triggered? Do structures without markers exist\
 , and what can be made of a marker outside structure? Do parataxis and hyp
 otaxis reflect distinct operations? - in which case\, how should the conju
 nctions be analysed? How is asyndeton construed? What textual unit\, beyon
 d the utterance\, should be considered?\n\nThis leads to an essential ques
 tion in the (re)construal of meaning: Can we talk about the interaction of
  operations pertaining to markers on the one hand\, and operations pertain
 ing to structures on the other? In this case\, the latter exist separately
 \, are in synergy with the former\, and engender their own paradigms.\n\nA
 gain\, the aim is to compare linguistic theories and how each sheds light 
 on these questions. Diachronic studies may prove useful\, with the analysi
 s of the processes of lexicalization and grammaticalisation serving to enr
 ich the discussion about the relationship between markers and structures\,
  as would a study of phenomena relating to language acquisition.\n\nVenue:

SUMMARY:Usage-based Contact Linguistics
DTSTART;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20150520T000000
DTEND;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20150524T000000

DESCRIPTION:Usage-based views on language propose that lexicon and grammar
  are not separate modules but regions on a continuum that ranges from phon
 ologically specific lexical items to phonologically schematic (or 'empty')
  syntactic constructions (Langacker 1987\, 1988\, 1999\; Croft 2002\; Toma
 sello 2003\; Bybee 2006\, 2010). This view implies that generalizations em
 erge at variable degrees of specificity: patterns co-exist in a speaker's 
 mental representation with stored exemplars of word strings that instantia
 te them. While simple words and fully abstract patterns\, e.g. the ditrans
 itive construction\, form the two poles of the continuum\, many constructi
 ons occupy in-between points on the continuum\, e.g. \n\n- Lexical chunks\
 , defined as frequent word strings of compositional nature\, e.g. don't ha
 ve to worry \n- Formulaic sequences\, e.g. How are you?\; I think \n- Idio
 ms\, e.g. the bane of my existence \n- Partially schematic constructions\,
  whether morphological in nature\, e.g. plural [N-(e)s]\, or morphosyntact
 ic\, e.g. predicative [I'm Adj] or quotative [and she's like X] \n\nThe va
 rious phenomena exemplified above have been noted to make the jump from on
 e language to another in bilingual speech. Insertional codeswitching often
  involves lexical chunks (Backus 1996\, 2003)\; alternational codeswitchin
 g relies on formulaic sequences and frequently used turns of phrase\; loan
  translations introduce not just new lexical combinations but also constru
 ctional features associated with the model expressions in the source langu
 age\; and grammatical interference brings in new schematic constructions.\
 n\nThe premise of this thematic session is that an integration of diverse 
 explanations for the aforementioned phenomena is possible once the perspec
 tive of the usage-based approach is adopted\, since under this approach fu
 nction (or 'meaning')\, structure (or 'form') and processing (or 'cognitiv
 e basis of speech') are explicitly related to each other. Various recent s
 tudies have explored these issues (e.g. Doğruöz & Backus 2009\; Doğru
 öz & Gries 2012\; Frick 2013\; Backus 2013\; Zenner\, Speelman & Geeraert
 s 2013\; Khakimov forthc.). Empirically\, much of this work is concerned w
 ith multiword insertions\, and contact-induced constructional change\, but
  interest in other domains\, such as fixed expressions instantiating alter
 national codeswitching is growing.\n\nConvenors:\n\nAd Backus (Tilburg Uni

DESCRIPTION:Nesta terceira edição do Colóquio Brasileiro de Morfologia\
 , queremos continuar a tradição que consolida este evento como um espaç
 o de discussão de diferentes fenômenos e abordagens morfológicas. Devid
 o à alta qualidade dos trabalhos brasileiros realizadas nesse campo atual
 mente\, acreditamos que o evento trará ganhos\, não só para seus partic
 ipantes\, mas para que a pesquisa na área continue avançando. \n\nNo Bra
 sil\, as investigações sobre morfologia têm explorado uma série de fen
 ômenos com propósitos descritivos\, como documentação de línguas mino
 ritárias\, ou  teóricos\, como a refutação e corroboração de noçõe
 s teóricas. Não raro\, esses dois propósitos fazem parte de um mesmo tr
 abalho\, tornando as descrições inovadoras e importantes para os debates
  retroalimentadores entre teorias e dados. \n\nTambém são crescentes no 
 Brasil trabalhos em que a descrição dos fenômenos alimenta debates sobr
 e modelos teóricos específicos. Assim\, discussões sobre as propriedade
 s que permitem que uma série de segmentos seja interpretada como uma pala
 vra leva à exploração das consequências de essa ser uma unidade respon
 sável pelo mapeamento entre morfologia e fonologia. Na mesma esteira\, fe
 nômenos que mostram as fronteiras entre fonologia e morfologia são explo
 rados a serviço de uma caracterização mais acurada da geração de expr
 essões linguísticas pela gramática. Mais especificamente\, esses dados\
 , que acusam a proximidade entre fonologia e morfologia do ponto de vista 
 descritivo\, podem subsidiar a discussão da pertinência de uma gramátic
 a representacional ou derivacional.\n\nA interface entre sintaxe e morfolo
 gia é também explorada por aqueles autores que acreditam que o mesmo com
 ponente gerativo é responsável pela formação de palavras e sentenças.
  Sob esse viés\, uma série de fenômenos que suscitam questões morfofon
 ológicas\, morfossemânticas ou morfossintáticas são discutidos para qu
 e se refine essa hipótese de trabalho.\n\nEstudos diacrônicos são conte
 mplados nos estudos morfológicos realizados no país e são acompanhados 
 de reflexões sobre a evolução da língua portuguesa (em mais de uma var
 iedade) e sobre limites entre composição e derivação.\n\nTrabalhos com
 o a identificação de morfemas em línguas indígenas fazem parte de impo
 rtantes discussões sobre sistemas de caso e concordância.\n\nDa mesma fo
 rma\, a descrição do sistema pronominal do português brasileiro (PB) fo
 menta discussões sobre a fronteira entre a sintaxe e a morfologia. Não m
 enos importantes são os estudos sobre motivações semântico-cognitivas 
 para a criação de novos afixos e a reanálise morfossemântica.\n\nEssas
  diversas e complementares linhas de fazer morfológico no Brasil indicam 
 um futuro frutífero nos resultados das investigações que agora se fazem
 . \n\nAlém disso\, também indicam a pertinência de eventos especializad
 os em que pessoas com interesses comuns possam se beneficiar dos comentár
 ios uns dos outros. Esses fatos nos alegram e nos incentivam a convidar a 
 todos os interessados em Morfologia a fazer parte do III  Colóquio Brasil
 eiro de Morfologia que\, acreditamos\, firma-se como um espaço qualificad
 o e frutífero de diálogo entre pesquisadores.  \n\nEsta edição do even
 to será realizada na Universidade de São Paulo e está sendo organizada 
 pelos membros do Grupo de Estudos em Morfologia Distribuída (GREMD). Um W
 orkshop em comemoração aos 11 anos de existência do grupo será realiza
 do no dia 25. Para mais detalhes\, acesse http://gremd.fflch.usp.br/cbm-wo

DESCRIPTION:Specialist Panel: 'Crisis\, What Crisis?'\n\nPanel Rationale a
 nd Context: Crisis as a pervasive concept across academic disciplines. The
  most recent 'trigger' is the economic crisis in Europe and North America.
  Language-based research into this crisis\, or indeed any crisis\, is rela
 tively speaking less developed than that conducted in other disciplines\, 
 notably sociology and economics. Extant work is often based on legitimate 
 cases studies\, the discourses of a given political\, news\, environmental
 \, language policy\, economic etc crisis. \n\nThe panel aim is to take sto
 ck and to go back a few steps into discussing the discourses around the no
 tion of crisis in order to advance our understanding of how to carry the t
 erm forward in sociolinguistic / discourse analytic research.  After all\,
  as Castells et al (2012:7) argue in their sociological work on the cultur
 es of the most recent economic crisis\, a 'crisis\, its conflicts and its 
 treatment are always social processes. And these social processes\, as all
  others\, are enacted and shaped by the interests\, values\, beliefs and s
 trategies of social actors.' That being the case\, language can provide in
 valuable insights into the meanings and circumstances of a 'crisis'\, whet
 her at a local\, national or international level.  Williams (2012)\, too\,
  highlights the role of language in deepening our understanding of the not
 ions of crisis and crisis aftermath. Her historical review of these two te
 rms reveals\, amongst other things\, the discursive\, ongoing reconstructi
 on that has led from treating crisis as a turning point\, something immine
 nt on the historical horizon\, to an immanent condition (see also Kermade 
 1966\, 2000).  \n\nPanel Organisers:\n\n- Prof. Nuria Lorenzo-Dus (http://

DESCRIPTION:In pragmatics\, a considerable amount of research has been con
 ducted to reveal ways in which we express linguistic politeness by minimiz
 ing face-threatening acts and interpersonal friction. But however much we 
 attempt to be cooperative and polite with others\, conflicts arise on many
  levels of our lives and therefore discourse on conflicts is necessary. He
 re\, conflicts exist due to the discrepancy between what is expected and w
 hat actually happens. In this panel\, we call such a discrepancy 'discorda
 nce' and broadly define it as 'awareness of a lack of agreement\, harmony\
 , or conformity.' As a large body of literature on\, for example\, disagre
 ement indicates\, discordance is not uncommon and there is still much to e
 xplore. \n\nIn the panel 'Discourse and discordance: Linguistic\, pragmati
 c\, and sociocultural strategies for aaccordance\,' we will examine discor
 dance from semantic\, pragmatic\, and paralinguistic points of view and in
  the sociocultural and historical context. Discordance becomes apparent an
 d recognized if participants express awkwardness linguistically or paralin
 guistically. However\, as in Gumperz's 'contextualization cues' (1982)\, i
 t is most often implicit\, not tangible\, and can be overlooked in the cou
 rse of communication. In this panel\, we aim to demonstrate that certain g
 enres of communication (for example\, mass media or narratives on myth) ex
 plicitly identify and express the discrepancy between what is expected and
  what actually happens\, and they form metapragmatic discourse by creating
  an ideological gap.

DESCRIPTION:Legal pragmatics may be said to have been created with the pub
 lication of John Austin’s Harvard lectures How to Do Things With Words i
 n 1962\, in which he illustrates the concept of performative by legal and 
 quasi-legal utterances such as “I do” as in “I do take this woman to
  be my lawful wedded wife”\, or “I give and bequeath my watch to my br
 other”. The concept of speech acts – without the modern terminology 
 – has of course been understood by jurists and others for a long time\, 
 e.g. John Austin 1832\, Olivecrona 1939 (1971)\, Hart 1961.\n\nMuch water 
 has flown under the bridge since Austin’s work and the work of his succe
 ssor John Searle became known to philosophers of language and to linguists
  in the 1960s and 1970s. Later\, Grice’s Cooperative Principle and his a
 nalysis of the distinction between literal and non-literal meaning have co
 me into the picture. The panel on legal pragmatics will reflect not only v
 arious pragmatic approaches to legal discourse but also the analysis of le
 gal discourse as a source of evidence for pragmatic turns.

DESCRIPTION:Semantic relations observed in what are commonly known as exis
 tential constructions and the operations by which they are established hav
 e common features in many languages of the world\, but beside these simila
 rities there are also important formal variations. The notion of an existe
 ntial sentence\, introduced into linguistic terminology by Jespersen (1924
 )\, cannot be reduced to the idea of asserting or denying the existence of
  an entity in the philosophical sense.\n\nIn this symposium\, we propose a
 s a starting point for the study of existential constructions two approach
 es to the definition of existential predication:\n\n- Existential predicat
 ion can be viewed as a specific operation of locating one term (locatum\, 
 fr. repéré/figure) relative to another (locator\, fr. repère/ground\, e
 xpressed by means of a non-canonical marking of constituents and/or a non-

DESCRIPTION:In the age of ever-changing information and communication tech
 nologies (the Internet of Everything)\, global economy production and dist
 ribution processes are deeply impacted by the demand for information in mu
 ltiple languages and localized content through intercultural communication
 . The volume of economic\, business\, financial and institutional translat
 ion increases each day: governments strive for plain and accessible inform
 ation\; institutions and agencies operate in more than one language\; mult
 inationals produce documents in multiple languages to expand their service
 s all around the world\, and large businesses and SMEs also have to adopt 
 a multilingual approach when accessing new markets in new countries.\n\nTr
 anslation and interpreting training institutions such as universities have
  always been aware of the need for training in this area. This awareness i
 s evident in their curricula\, which include subjects such as specialized 
 translation and economic or institutional translation. Trainers and resear
 chers are increasingly interested in knowing and researching the intricaci
 es and aspects of this type of translation: its discourse\, terminology\, 
 phraseology and metaphoric uses\; its relation to plain language initiativ
 es\, new technologies\, as well as teaching approaches\, contrastive analy
 sis\, project management\, etc. From this perspective\, and following the 
 success of the first Conference held in 2014 at the University of Alicante
 \, the Département des langues modernes et de traduction of Université d
 u Québec à Trois-Rivières seeks to bring together translation practitio
 ners\, researchers\, teachers as well as other parties engaged in economic
 \, commercial\, financial and institutional translation in order to discus
 s and debate the following issues:\n\nNew research trends in the field of 
 economic\, commercial\, financial and institutional translation\nThe impac

DESCRIPTION:Full title: Adaptability\, contextualism\, and the composition
  of discourse meaning\n\nContextualism about meaning is a view according t
 o which substantial contribution of pragmatic information is allowed in th
 e truth-evaluable content of an utterance. The orientation subsumes many d
 ifferent approaches but according to all of them pragmatic aspects of the 
 representation that undergoes a truth-conditional analysis go beyond the b
 asic list that includes personal and demonstrative pronouns\, adverbs such
  as ‘here’\, ‘there’\, ‘now’\,  and some other\, but very few\
 , expression types (see Cappelen and Lepore 2005 and Kaplan 1989). Until r
 ecently\, the debate concerning the degree to which pragmatics ‘intrudes
 ’ in the semantic representation focused on the putative existence of co
 vert variables in the logical form (e.g. Stanley 2000). This gave rise to 
 the debate between the so-called indexicalists and those for whom pragmati
 c components of meaning are free from structural constraints and operate 
 ‘top-down’ either as a modulation of the logical form (Recanati 2004\,
  2010) or as the output of sources of meaning that jointly produce a truth
 -evaluable representation (Jaszczolt 2005\, 2010). However\, in the most r
 ecent literature a greater burden has been placed on the properties of lex
 ical items themselves. Recanati (2012) proposes that utterance meanings ar
 e both compositional and flexible: they enter the process of (pragmatic) c
 omposition only after the context-driven modulation has taken place.\n\nTh
 is panel attempts to shed more light on some pertinent and as yet unresolv
 ed questions in these recent debates (Please see the Call for Papers for m
 ore information). \n\nSelected References:\n \nCappelen\, H. & E. Lepore.

DESCRIPTION:Panel Organisers: \n\nValeria Sinkeviciute (IPrA Research Cent
 er\, University of Antwerp)\nMarta Dynel (Department of Pragmatics\, Unive
 rsity of Lodz)\n\nConversational humour that encompasses various subtypes\
 , such as teasing\, banter\, deprecating humour\, or figures of speech use
 d for humorous purposes (e.g. humorous irony) (Dynel 2009) has been studie
 d in diverse discourse genres\, written or spoken\, private or mass-mediat
 ed\, face-to-face or computer-mediated\, such as: everyday talk collated i
 n corpora\, messenger exchanges\, or conversations in reality programmes\,
  talk shows\, or television series\, each of which offers fertile ground f
 or humour. \nThe proposed panel is devoted to the pragmatics of conversati
 onal humour and aims at exploring humour in relation to cognitive\, social
  and cultural phenomena. Taking many forms and guises\, conversational hum
 our serves multiple communicative purposes and performs diverse interperso
 nal functions\, for example\, bonding and solidarity building\, or\, by co
 ntrast\, promoting animosity and hostility. This explains why conversation
 al humour can be examined with the methodological apparatus developed in (
 im)politeness studies (Dynel 2013\; Haugh and Bousfield 2012\; Sinkeviciut
 e 2013). Furthermore\, humour's capacity to convey non-humorous meanings o
 utside the humorous frame and the nature of the speaker's intentions under
 lying the production of a humorous message have been another major focus i
 n humour research. Alongside intentionality\, the negotiability of meaning
  (during the interaction or evolving through metatalk) is a key aspect in 
 the interpretation of conversational humour. Finally\, both the production
  and interpretation of humour highly depend on a cultural context in which
  it occurs. Cultural attitudes\, values and proscriptions are subconscious
  'rules' that guide the speakers in their language use and can easily infl
 uence one's understanding of (non-) humorous interactions (e.g. Holmes and
  Hay 1997\; Goddard 2006\, 2009\; Sinkeviciute 2014).

 s soon as men and women began to speak. Nevertheless\, throughout\nhistory
 there have been multiple attempts to limitthe scope/number of languages--o
 ften due to politics or thedesire for convenience. This on-going effort ha
 s involved the systematic use of a lingua franca\n(currently English\, his
 torically others) or the utopic quest for an ideal vehicular language such
  as Volapük or Esperanto. In any event\, linguistic diversity has never r
 eally been threatened and the translation process(es) have always been con
 sidered at the very core of human exchange. Yet today translation plays an
 d has to play an even more important role than before in a context where t
 he magnitude of globalization reinforces the hegemonic dream of a neatly c
 onstructed homogenized culture whose range is supposed to move us toward t
 he universal. During our symposium\, we will tackle a variety of issues th

DESCRIPTION:During the past few decades\, research in the area of bilingua
 l cognitive and linguistic development has made tremendous progress and pr
 ovided evidence supporting the notion that speaking more than one language
  extends\, rather than diminishes\, an individual’s cognitive capacities
  (see Bialystok\, 2005\, for an overview). There is a strong argument in t
 he literature that bilingual development may result in establishing specif
 ic architectures of the mind that are likely to promote later cognitive ad
 vantages. On the other side\, according to the creative cognition approach
  (Ward\, Smith\, & Finke\, 1999)\, creativity is considered a product of n
 ormative cognitive functioning. Therefore\, increase in general cognitive 
 functioning may facilitate an individual’s creative abilities. If biling
 ualism results in more elaborate cognitive structures and/or functioning\,
  it may also facilitate creative functioning (Kharkhurin\, 2012). Unfortun
 ately\, the relationship between bilingualism and creativity received litt
 le attention in the scientific community. In about 40 years\, this theme h
 ad been explored in only 40 studies. Only recently\, this theme was resusc
 itated and received systematic empirical investigation. The aim of this se
 ssion is to present the state of the art research in bilingual creativity\
 , which perceives the relationship between these human endeavors from the 
 cognitive\, sociocultural\, and educational perspectives.

DESCRIPTION:La didactique des langues étrangères fédère des recherches
  fondées sur des théories ancrées dans différentes disciplines\, qui s
 'attachent à des contextes variés et portent  sur des objets de grande a
 mpleur ou sur des objets spécialisés liés à l'appropriation d'une ou d
 e plusieurs langues par des apprenants et /ou  aux rôles de différents a
 cteurs dans la facilitation  de cette appropriation langagière.\n\nLes co
 lloques de l'Association des Chercheurs et  Enseignants Didacticiens des L
 angues Étrangères (ACEDLE) sont conçus comme des lieux de débat et de 
 rencontre\, où toutes les sensibilités peuvent trouver un lieu d'express
 ion et de confrontation\, où les chercheurs peuvent échanger sur leurs t
 ravaux en cours à la lumière des avancées dans des secteurs proches.\n\
 nÀ la croisée des recherches actuellement menées en didactique des lang
 ues et de la formation des enseignants en langue\, le colloque ACEDLE 2015
  : « Interagir pour apprendre les langues aujourd'hui » se propose d'une
  part\, de dresser un état des lieux des usages de la langue et des appre
 ntissages  langagiers dans les interactions pédagogiques et didactiques\,
  en présentiel et/ou à distance\, dans les contextes très diversifiés 
 que rencontrent les enseignants de langue.  Le colloque propose d'autre pa
 rt\, de faire le point sur l'emploi des corpus d'interactions  d'un point 
 de vue méthodologique et d'un point de vue théorique pour penser leur mo
 bilisation dans la recherche et la formation en  didactique des langues.\n
 \nAxes  proposés :\n\n1. Les usages de la langue dans les interactions en
  présentiel et/ou à distance aujourd'hui\n\nLa prise en compte du pluril
 inguisme des apprenants\, réelle ou fantasmée\,  et l'usage croissant de
 s TIC ont-ils un impact sur les interactions langagières dans les disposi
 tifs  d'enseignement ?\n\n 2. L'appropriation langagière  dans les  inter
 actions\, directe et/ou à distance  et contextes d'enseignement/apprentis
 sage\n\nComment les contextes d'enseignement /apprentissage\, conçus pour
  des apprenants  aux attentes distinctes (ENA du primaire et secondaire\, 
  public adulte en situation professionnelle\,   étudiants  des centres de
  langues\,  étudiants en formation initiale  en mobilité\, étudiants en
  langues étrangères dans le secondaire et le supérieur dans leur pays\,
  etc.)\,  qui ont en commun de valoriser les interactions verbales entre a
 pprenants et enseignants d'une part  et entre pairs d'autre part \,  ont-i
 ls des incidences sur les types et les degrés d'apprentissage langagier ?
 \n\n3. Le recours aux corpus d'interactions dans la formation des enseigna
 nts de langue\n\nQuels types de corpus d'interactions  sont aujourd'hui ut
 ilisés en  formation initiale  et continue des enseignants en langues ?  
 À quelles conditions les grands corpus complexes d'interactions qui se d
 éveloppent  constituent-ils\, ou peuvent-ils constituer une ressource pou

 5\n\nNo doubt the teaching and learning of foreign languages has undergone
  a great upheaval in recent decades with the advent of new Information and
  Communication Technologies in general\, and ICT in Learning and Teaching 
 Foreign Languages in particular. Learners today are not the same as those 
 of yesterday. Today's learners are totally immersed in technology. They sp
 end significant periods of time in front of the computer on the internet u
 sing laptops\, tablets and other technological means to access social netw
 orks and forums.\n\nUsing the old teaching methods will only strengthen th
 e already existing gap between the learners and teachers\, and this especi
 ally true with foreign languages. Thus\, employing these new technologies 
 in teaching is inevitable for effective results in today's digital world.\
 n\nThis symposium is intended as a field of reflections on the real contri

DESCRIPTION:The XXXIV. Romanistentag\, the biannual conference of the Germ
 an Society of Romance Philology (Deutscher Romanistenverband\; DRV)\, will
  take place at the University of Mannheim\, which is mainly located in Man
 nheim Palace\, from July 26 to July 29\, 2015.\n\nThe provocative conferen
 ce theme 'Romance Philology and Economy: Structure\, Culture\, and Literat
 ure' was deliberately selected in order to invite participants to critical
 ly investigate the various dimensions of the term 'economy' within the ent
 ire spectrum of objects of investigation in Romance studies. The motivatio
 n for this choice is twofold.\n\nOn the one hand\, it is related to lingui
 stic\, literary\, and media/cultural domains of economic factors and the p
 revailing area-specific\, relatively distinct characteristics. These areas
  include the level of linguistic structures\, economic aspects of multilin
 gualism and cultural diversity\, as well as literary forms and the economi
 c conditionings of language teaching. Therefore\, the economic dimension m
 ay also be regarded as a force directed towards systematic efficiency\, be
 yond any pecuniary economic notion: for instance\, as the primary cause fo
 r phonetic\, morphological\, and syntactic changes\, or as the driving for
 ce in the processes of writing\, translation\, and publication\, as well a
 s in narrative and poetic text structures.\n\nOn the other hand\, the conf
 erence theme aims at the function of Romance philology as a seismograph in
  recent\, economically induced social dynamics in Romance-speaking regions
  and at a regenerated reflection on its role as a discipline as well as it
 s uniting effect in the European and non-European context.\n\nThe board in
 vites all scholars of Romance languages and literatures who are interested
  in the formation of a section to submit proposals in a presentation of tw
 o pages (including bibliographical references) to the chairwoman of the DR
 V (see below) via post and email by June 20\, 2014. For the selection proc
 ess\, a top-class program advisory council will be consulted.\n\nWe are lo
 oking forward to lively and controversial discussions at the Romanistentag

DESCRIPTION:En el centenario del Quijote de Avellaneda y en vísperas del 
 de la espléndida réplica cervantina\, nos parece oportuno plantear un es
 pacio de discusión científica sobre un asunto apenas tratado hasta la fe
 cha: la configuración y evolución del español a lo largo del siglo XVII
 \, partiendo del modelo (actuante ya en su siglo) que ofrecen el alcalaín
 o y sus contemporáneos y trazando la historia de las modificaciones susta
 nciales que acabarán desembocando\, ya a principios del siglo XVIII\, en 
 la lengua de Feijoo o Torres Villarroel.\n\nLa debida atención a la histo
 ricidad de una lengua exige de la investigación diacrónica que atienda a
  las transformaciones del conjunto de las tradiciones discursivas mediante
  las que dicha lengua se sustancia y manifiesta. En este sentido\, el sigl
 o XVII no es solo una época de intenso cambio morfosintáctico: es tambi
 én un periodo en que se ensayan múltiples formas discursivas nuevas y en
  que otras heredadas alcanzan un alto grado de elaboración dentro de la l
 engua de la distancia\; la misma arquitectura del discurso\, en fin\, se m
 odifica sustancialmente entre fines del Quinientos y el primer cuarto del 
 siglo XVII. \n\nPese a la importancia del siglo XVII en la historia cultur
 al de España\, no contamos con estudios que caractericen de forma exhaust
 iva los cambios lingüísticos en desarrollo a lo largo de ese tiempo y su
  (variable) plasmación en la escritura\, ni tampoco que aborden con la su
 ficiente profundidad la configuración de normas que\, al calor del asenta
 miento de Madrid como 'capital de dos mundos'\, sientan las bases del est
 ándar europeo actual y se constituyen en punto de partida para el desarro
 llo de las actuales variedades americanas. La obra cervantina\, y en gener
 al la lengua del primer tercio del siglo XVII\, ofrecen así una piedra an
 gular fiable para sustentar sobre ella el análisis variacional del resto 
 del Seiscientos.\n\nLa lengua de Cervantes ha sido utilizada como modelo d
 e imitación o fuente del canon lingüístico y como referencia para la tr
 adición gramatical posterior. Otros aspectos\, sin embargo\, han recibido
  menos atención: cabe preguntarse\, por ejemplo\, de qué tradiciones pre
 vias parte la representación\, variacionalmente diversa\, de modelos ling
 üísticos que vemos reflejada en el propio Quijote\,hasta qué punto el r
 ecurso a los usos lingüísticos cervantinos ha eclipsado la descripción 
 de otros rasgos de su tiempo o condicionado el tratamiento y valoración d
 e los que se han descrito. \n\nRespecto de la lengua del periodo en genera
 l\, debe esclarecerse aún\, por ejemplo\, cómo se articulan las isoglosa
 s de variación geolectal -dentro de España y en América- tras la consol
 idación de la capital madrileña\; de qué forma interaccionaron la creci
 ente producción metalingüística de ese tiempo\, el establecimiento de p
 atrones firmes de expresión de la lengua de la distancia y la tendencia a
  la conformación de normas de prestigio locales o globales\; qué cambios
  no se llegaron a estabilizar en la lengua común\; de qué modo se compor
 tan los autores y textos del periodo respecto de arcaísmos\, vulgarismos\
 , innovaciones o extranjerismos (incluidos los latinos)\; o\, en fin\, en 
 qué medida los cambios lingüísticos de este tiempo se prolongaron en el
  siglo XVIII\, y qué consecuencias tendría tal (dis)continuidad para la 
 periodización del español.

DESCRIPTION:The prosody and meaning of (non-)canonical questions across la
 nguages\nDaniela Wochner\, Nicole Dehé\, Bettina Braun (U Konstanz) & Bes
 te Kamali\, Hubert Truckenbrodt (ZAS Berlin)\n\nInvited Speakers:\n\nSigri
 d Beck \nNancy Hedberg\n\nThe workshop is integrated into the annual meeti
 ng of the German Linguistic Society in Leipzig and takes place there on Ma
 rch 4–6 2015. It is interested in the syntax\, prosody\, semantics and t
 he interfaces of different questions and question types across languages.\
 n\nAdditional details concerning the planned content:\n\nFor canonical que
 stions\, the workshop is particularly interested in the relation between q
 uestions and focus in the different modules of grammar\, and in the role o
 f the intonation contour in different questioning types. Where do question
 s show question-specific stress or phrasing patterns? Where do wh-phrases 
 show similarities to focused phrases? Why do the alternatives in alternati
 ve questions show focus prosody? Intervention effects are an important top
 ic in the interaction between focus and wh-phrases and/or alternatives in 
 alternative questions. Are there other interactions as well? What question
 -specific intonation contours or question-specific assignment of intonatio
 n contours do different languages show\, and how is the variation to be un
 derstood?\n\nThe non-canonical questions that the workshop is interested i
 n include those which (i) besides being used as requests for information\,
  have further pragmatic dimensions\; (ii) have non-interrogative syntax\; 
 and/or (iii) may be identified as non-canonical through their prosody\, or
  any combination of these properties. Example types are declarative questi
 ons\, tag questions\, and rhetorical questions. We would like to see if va
 rious well-known –but not uncontroversial- properties of non-canonical q
 uestions stand up to closer scrutiny: \n\nAre declarative questions and ta
 gs always confirmation-seeking rather than information-seeking? Do declara
 tive questions always have rising intonation and why? How to approach the 
 illocutionary force of assertion in rhetorical questions and to what exten
 t can their prosody inform us? How do modal particles such as schon in Ger
 man contribute to the rhetorical question pragmatics?

DESCRIPTION:This Conscila Study day devoted to the study of grammar and st
 ylistics of discourse genre\, aims to bring together researchers in lingui
 stics or NLP whose work focuses on the identification of lexico- grammatic
 al textual features.\n\nThierry Charnois (University of Paris 13\, LIPN)\,
  Sascha Diwersy (Universität zu Köln)\, Meri Larjavaara (Åbo Akademi)\,
  Dominique Legallois (University of Caen\, Crisco)\n\nMeeting email: domin
 ique.legallois@unicaen.fr \n\nIn recent years\, automatic text analysis ha
 s enabled a more accurate identification of lexical and grammatical featur
 es of texts and genres. There are two main approaches\, the first being mo
 re widespread than the second :\n\n1. The paradigmatic approach rests upon
  the quantification of morpho-syntactic categories. For instance\, in his 
 work on oral discourse in the academic community\, Biber 2006 uncovers the
  over-usage (in comparison with written discourse) of first person pronoun
 s\, of evaluative expressions ('mental' verbs\, modal adverbs\, etc.)\, of
  WH- questions\, etc. By means of factorisation\, it is possible to determ
 ine a set of properties particular to a specific genre.\n\n2. The syntagma
 tic approach focuses on the combination of lexical units\, the identificat
 ion of preferred\, or dispreferred\, syntagmatic segments by genre. To giv
 e an illustration of this\,  consider the lexico-grammatical structure nam
 ed 'pattern' or motif in Quiniou et al\, ce N si ADJ et si ADJ (lit : That
  N so ADJ and so ADJ). This semantico-evaluative pattern is specific to th
 e 19th century genre of Memoirs\, in comparison with Travel narrative\, No
 vels\, Correspondence\, Essays of the same period :\n\nOh ! Tant mieux\, t

DESCRIPTION:Si l’on voulait créer une science de métaphrasométrie\, d
 ont le but serait de mesurer la réception internationale d’un livre par
  la parution de ses traductions en langues étrangères\, il faudrait d’
 abord détruire tout témoignage des traductions du Cours de linguistique 
 générale. Aucune science ne pourrait prendre en considération toutes le
 s motivations\, toutes les conditions\, tous les accidents qui auraient d
 éterminé\, par exemple\, que les traductions russe et japonaise ont pré
 cédé celles dans les langues de l’Europe occidentale\, qu’aucune tra
 duction anglaise n’est parue avant 1959\, malgré l’importance capital
 e du Cours pour Bloomfield aux Etats-Unis et Firth en Grande-Bretagne.\n\n
 Néanmoins\, il y a des enseignements à tirer des traductions avec plus d
 e certitude. Elles nous fournissent une source incomparable de détails su
 r la façon dont le Cours fut lu dans les cultures linguistiques de ses tr
 aducteurs. Il ne faut pas sous-estimer la valeur de ces détails\, car\, c
 hez les lecteurs qui n’ont pas laissé de traductions\, de telles preuve
 s ne se présentent qu’implicitement dans leurs commentaires\, et surtou
 t dans leurs caprices d’interprétation (on hésite à dire « erreurs 
 ») si d’aventure ils ont été rendus publics.\n\nEn donnant les leçon
 s à partir desquelles Bally et Sechehaye ont façonné le Cours de lingui
 stique générale\, Saussure était aux prises non seulement avec la lingu
 istique de son époque\, mais avec la langue française et les obstacles q
 u’elle présente pour une compréhension logique et non ambigüe des ph
 énomènes langagiers. Les traducteurs doivent recréer ces batailles men
 ées par Saussure dans des champs différents du sien\, parfois massivemen
 t\, parfois plus légèrement. Pour le traducteur\, les petites différenc
 es sont souvent plus difficiles à régler que les grandes.\n\nNous espér
 ons avoir un assez large éventail des langues dans lesquelles le Cours a 
 été publié\, et éventuellement des langues dans lesquelles on ne trouv
 e encore aucune traduction. Ce que nous visons à produire n’est pas une
  métaphrasométrie\, mais une métaphrasologie qui nous ouvrira de nouvel
 les perspectives\, aussi bien sur les problèmes et les énigmes de traduc
 tion saussurienne que sur l’histoire des lectures transculturelles du Co

DESCRIPTION:Since its advent in the 1960s\, Systemic Functional Linguistic
 s (SFL) has tried to “provide something to think with\, a framework of r
 elated concepts that can be drawn on in many different contexts where ther
 e are problems that turn out to be\, when investigated\, essentially probl
 ems of language” Halliday (2009: viii). In fact\, SFL has attracted the 
 attention of scholars in a wide range of domains who have used it as a the
 oretical resource to analyze various types of texts\, describe a significa
 nt number of languages and offer theoretical explications of how language 
 and other semiotic systems work. The continual progress and evolution of S
 FL as a fully developed linguistic theory has made of it more than just an
  efficient analytic tool as it has gained the power to contribute to the d
 evelopment of many domains\, ranging from those which are theory-oriented 
 such as (Critical) Discourse Analysis\, and Computational Linguistics to t
 hose which are quite practical where problems have to be solved\, such as 
 Language Learning and Teaching and Clinical Applications\, to cite a few.\
 n\nThanks to this functional orientation and this “daring to develop app
 liable linguistics when application was a sign of theoretical impurity” 
 (Matthiessen\, 2014)\, SFL has raised theoretical debates with other forma
 lly/structurally-oriented accounts/theories of language. This dialogical i
 nteraction with other theories can be seen not only as sign of complementa
 rity\, as it is “unlikely that any one account of language will be appro
 priate for all purposes” (Halliday\, 1994)\, but also as evidence for th
 is complex phenomenon that has intrigued linguists and philosophers since 
 the ancient Greek times: Language.     \n\nUpon this rests the theme of th
 e conference with the aim of bringing together researchers from different 
 fields to contribute to the debate on the SFL Applications (appliability o
 f SFL analytic framework to other disciplines) and Implications (theoretic
 al interaction with other theories).

DESCRIPTION:The Fifth ISLOJ\nInternational Symposium on the Languages of J
 ava\n					\n6-7 June 2015\nUniversitas Pendidikan Indonesia\nBandung\, Wes
 t Java\, Indonesia\n\nThe island of Java is home to several major language
 s. Javanese—spoken mainly in Central and East Java— is the world’s 1
 0th or 11th largest language in number of native speakers. It has one of t
 he oldest and fullest recorded histories of any Austronesian language. It 
 also has been of considerable interest to scholars because of the system o
 f speech levels or speech styles found in a number of varieties of Javanes
 e. Sundanese—spoken in West Java— has over 27 million speakers\, and M
 adurese—spoken on the neighboring island of Madura and throughout parts 
 of East Java—is the third largest local language\, with counts ranging f
 rom 7 to 13 million speakers. Varieties of both of these languages have sp
 eech level systems and such systems can also be found in the geographicall
 y\, historically\, and linguistically related languages on the neighboring
  islands of Bali and Lombok. Each of these languages displays a range of d
 ialects\, isolects\, continua\, and contact varieties and yet they have re
 ceived relatively little attention from linguists. With this symposium\, w
 e offer an opportunity for scholars working on any aspect of Javanese\, Su
 ndanese\, Madurese\, Balinese and Sasak to come together and share their f
 indings. We aim to encourage and promote continued research on these impor
 tant and unique languages. \n\nThe keynote address will be delivered by Pr
 ofessor Dr. Bernd Nothofer\, Goethe-Universität Frankfurt.\n\nPlease note
  that the 19th International Symposium on Malay-Indonesian Linguistics (IS
 MIL 19) will be held following ISLOJ\, at Jambi University\, Jambi City\,

 ed in colour naming. The workshop will provide new evidence regarding lexi
 calization patterns of colour terms from a cross-linguistic perspective. I
 t will also point to some regular lexicalization patterns shared by differ

DESCRIPTION:Modelling conditionality\n \nThis workshop is part of the DGfS
  2015 meeting in Leipzig.\n\nConditionals are a particularly interesting p
 art of language because they offer insight into the way humans reason abou
 t possibilities. While analyses traditionally focus on the syntax and sema
 ntics of English hypothetical conditionals\, other languages employ differ
 ent strategies to talk about conditionality. Recently there has been an ef
 fort to broaden the focus from modelling only English hypothetical conditi
 onals to include other languages\, other types of conditionals (e.g. anank
 astics\; relevance conditionals\; Imperative And/Or Declarative constructi
 ons)\, and insights from language processing. Nonetheless modelling the in
 teraction of different types of conditionals with tense and mood remains a
  difficult challenge to compositional semantics. \n\nThis workshop aims to
  provide a forum to discuss models for the syntax and semantics of differe
 nt conditional constructions in natural language (particularly understudie
 d languages\, but also English and German)\, and to challenge these models
  with experimental data. \n\nInvited Speaker:\n\nKai von Fintel (MIT)\n\nO

DESCRIPTION:As the second most spoken Romance language and the fourth most
  spoken additional language in the world\, Portuguese is considered a lang
 uage of the future and is predicted to be spoken by 335 million people aro
 und the world by 2050. In the area of higher education\, there has been a 
 substantial increase in the number of foreign exchange students entering B
 razilian and Portuguese higher education institutions. Therefore\, contrib
 utions aimed at improving the teaching-learning processes of Portuguese as
  an Additional Language (PAL) are much needed at the academic level.\n\nTh
 e aim of the panel is to bring together works in language acquisition\, cr
 oss-cultural comparison and other corpus-based analyses in order to highli
 ght author presence in Portuguese academic productions. Author presence in
 cludes terms such as 'stance' (Biber 2003\, 2012)\, a broad concept that r
 efers to how an author positions himself with respect to the target audien
 ce through the use of a variety of linguistic elements (e.g. pronoun choic
 es) and strategies (e.g. hedging).\n\nAs Hyland (2002) claims\, a central 
 element of pragmatic competence is the ability of language users to constr
 uct a credible representation of themselves and their work\, aligning them
 selves with the socially shaped identities of their communities. In this s
 ense\, academic writing and speaking\, like all forms of communication\, i
 s an act of identity. In addition to conveying the scientific information\
 , it also reflects the dominant cultural values of a linguistic community.
  Therefore\, pragmatic resources are employed to share meanings\, signal w
 ho we are and to draw in\, influence and persuade readers and listeners.

SUMMARY:Les Syntagmes Prépositionnels Prédicatifs : Syntaxe\, Sémantiqu

DTEND;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20150519T000000
UID:http://linguistlist.org/issues/25/25-2921.html
DESCRIPTION:Si les linguistes s'accordent en général pour soutenir que l
 es prépositions expriment un rapport entre deux éléments\, il n'y a pas
  de consensus quand il s’agit de préciser quels sont les termes qui ent
 rent dans ce rapport.\n\nD’une part\, il est généralement admis que l
 ’un des deux termes est un nom\, ou une catégorie assimilable\, appelé
  son « complément ». Sur cette base formelle stable\, il existe des ét
 udes abondantes consacrées à la complémentation de la préposition \; e
 lles cherchent pour la plupart à déterminer les facteurs sémantiques et
  pragmatiques qui déterminent la rection d’une préposition particuliè
 re (Spang-Hanssen 1963\, Schwarze 1981\, Cervoni 1992\, Berthonneau & Cadi
 ot 1991\, 1993\, Vandeloise 1993\, Kupferman 2001\,Melis 2003\, Leeman\, 2
 008\, etc.).\n\nD’autre part\, le second terme du rapport a inspiré des
  études sur diverses « fonctions » syntaxiques que peuvent assumer les 
 syntagmes prépositionnels : en effet\, le syntagme constitué par la pré
 position et le nom régi peut dépendre d’un nom ((la conversation\, les
  invités) à table/dans le jardin)\, d’un verbe (les enfants (sont\, re
 stent\, vont..) à table/dans le jardin \; les parents (envoient\, laissen
 t…) les enfants à table/dans le jardin)\, et même d’une phrase (les 
 enfants ne doivent pas jouer à table/dans le jardin). La fonction n’est
  pas toujours claire : ainsi\, dans certains cas\, on peut se demander s'i
 l s’agit d’un complément de lieu ou d’un attribut (voir\, par exemp
 le\, quelques-unes desnombreuses études sur la valeur locative du SP : Er
 iksson 1980\, Vandeloise 1986\, Borillo 1998\, etc.).\n\nMalgré la diverg
 ence fonctionnelle « de surface »\, les SP ont souvent en commun la fonc
 tion « prédicative » à un certain niveau d’analyse\, soit par paraph
 rase (les invités qui sont (à table/dans le jardin))\, soit par implicat
 ion (les parent (envoient\, laissent…) les enfants à table/dans le jard
 in implique les enfants sont à table/dans le jardin\, pendant le procès 
 dans le cas de laisser\, après le procès dans le cas d’envoyer).\n\nPa
 r ailleurs\, la question sur la préposition et le syntagme prépositionne
 l est également un sujet qui intéresse la typologie\, compte tenu du nom
 bre et de la variété des prépositions utilisées dans diverses langues 
 (cf. Hagège 1975\, Lemaréchal 1989\, Creissels 1995).\n\nCe workshop don
 nera l'occasion de débattre de la question et d('essayer) de dégager un 
 nouveau consensus\, sur un type particulier de SP : ceux qui apparaissent 
 dans des phrases copulatives (Luc est en colère\, Luc est à la bourre\, 
 Luc est dans l’embarras\, etc.) assumant la fonction d’attribut (cf. R
 iegel 1985\, De Gaulmyn & Rémi-Giraud 1991\, Van Peteghem 1991). La posit
 ion post-copule est en effet un lieu de confluence de différents types de
  SP\, dont la morphosyntaxe a\, certes\, fait l’objet d’études\, surt
 out du point de vue du « figement » (cf. pour le français\, Danlos 1980
 \, 1988\, M. Gross 1996\, G. Gross 1996\, etc. \; pour l’anglais\, Macho
 nis 1988 \; pour le portugais\, Marques-Ranchhod1988\, Baptista 2000 \; po
 ur l’italien\, Vietri 1996 \; pour le grec\, Moustaki 1990\, etc.) ou du
  point de vue transformationnel (cf. Negroni-Peyre 1978\, Meunier 1981\, e
 tc.)\, mais dont le discernement fonctionnel semble toujours d’actualit
 é. Les études des SP dans des langues où une copule n’est pas obligat
 oire pour la constitution d’un énoncé minimal sont bienvenues.

DESCRIPTION:This Panel concentrates on the relationship between self and o
 ther in communicative activities. \nThe panel intends to focus discussion 
 on the linguistic means that speakers use to position:\n\n(a) Themselves\n
 (b) What they are communicating\n(c) Their interlocutors in an interaction
 al space\n\nLinguistic markers such as those indexing the speakers' subjec
 tivity are relevant in the construction of the relationship between self a
 nd other in the local context of interaction and in the wider context of s
 ocieties between groups of individuals. Although speakers manifest subject
 ivity at all levels of language\, this panel concentrates on elements belo
 nging to the socio-pragmatic domain.\n\nSpeakers pragmatically modify the 
 propositional content of utterances with\, e.g.\, hedges and boosters (a b
 it\, so) or pragmatic markers (like)\, and through these means convey thei
 r stances to guide the interpretation process. Similarly\, the relationshi
 p with the interlocutor can be co-constructed through self-defining stance
 s (I mean) and/or deferential address terms indexically associated with th
 e social identity of interlocutors.\n \nSome of these markers also acquire
  second or third order indexicalities (Silverstein 2003) when used by spea
 kers to represent themselves as members of societal groups (e.g. Eng. like
  in young speech\, T vs V address forms in present or past societies\, Cul
 peper 2011). Pragmatic and discourse markers are interesting cases in poin
 t as the choice of a marker can be associated with the needs of speakers t
 o belong to a particular social class (Huspek 1989) or in-group\, or to af
 filiate with different varieties of the same language (Aijmer 2009\, Cuenc
 a 2008). They can be associated with the social identities of speakers (so
 cial roles\, peer groups\, Andersen 2001)\, social relationships\, activit
 ies (debating\, interviewing)\, social acts (requests\, offers)\, attitude
 s and feelings (Andersen and Aijmer\, 2011). This discussion calls into qu
 estion\, but is not limited to\, deferential address terms\, pragmatic and
  discourse markers\, conversational routines\, levels of indexicalities\, 
 all to be intended as linguistic means to position the self and the other.

DESCRIPTION:Panel Organizers:\n	\nAssimakis Tseronis\, University of Amste
 rdam\nChiara Pollaroli\, Università della Svizzera italiana\nCharles Forc
 eville\, University of Amsterdam\n\nTheme:\n\nIn the last two decades or s
 o\, scholars from discourse analysis\, cognitive linguistics\, as well as 
 pragmatics and argumentation studies have started paying attention to the 
 non-verbal modes that interact with the verbal in a variety of media and c
 ommunicative genres. Within multimodal discourse analysis\, each mode is s
 tudied as realising part of the information communicated and their interac
 tion as contributing to meaning-making processes. In most of the studies w
 ithin multimodal analysis\, however\, the focus is more on the image-inter
 nal aspects than on the interaction between the image and the viewer and t
 he properties of the context that play a role in the interpretation proces
 s.\n\nCognitive approaches to visual communication\, by contrast\, have fo
 cused on the interpretation processes involved in understanding multimodal
  texts. However\, the focus on the cognitive processing has left the discu
 ssion of the effects of the choice among the various modes and of their co
 mbinations largely implicit. Pictorial tropes\, for example\, such as meta
 phor\, metonymy and irony\, have been studied more with an interest in ide
 ntifying their verbal and nonverbal cuing than an interest in the rhetoric
 al effects of their use\, or of the choice to cue them visually instead of
  verbally in a given piece of discourse.\n\nScholars from argumentation st
 udies who have taken seriously the role that visual images play in argumen
 tative discourse have paid little attention to the affordances of the vari
 ous modes\, focusing on what is depicted and overlooking issues of style a
 nd composition. Two approaches have emerged\, one thematizing the persuasi
 ve effect and emotional appeal of visuals\, the other examining their inde
 xical properties and thereby reducing them to their evidentiary function.\
 n\nFor an assessment of the use of non-verbal modes in argumentative commu
 nication\, a combination of insights from pragmatics\, multimodal analysis
 \, and argumentation studies is required if one is to account for their ro
 le in rational and cognitive terms rather than in purely aesthetic and aff
 ective terms. Discourse-oriented approaches to argumentation have traditio
 nally drawn insights from pragmatics in an attempt to account for the cont
 ext dependency of the identification and interpretation of arguments. The 
 question we then raise is: how can pragmatics also benefit the analysis of
  multimodal argumentative discourse?

DESCRIPTION:In this panel we delve into a research topic that is now being
  deemed of great interest in pragmatics: persuasion. In the literature\, p
 ersuasion is commonly associated with argumentation\, both being focused o
 n the addressee and expecting an action from him/her (Overstreet\, 2003\; 
 García-Gómez\, 2012\; Maillat\, 2013). Furthermore\, the relative effect
 iveness of persuasion tactics relies on the four Cs: credibility\, coheren
 ce\, congruence and consistency (O’Keefe\, 2002\; Metzger\, 2007). At th
 e same time\, because persuasion combines the appeal to the intellect with
  the appeal to emotions\, the understanding of how individuals use evaluat
 ive language in strategies of persuasion seems to be crucial (among many o
 thers\, Hardin\, 2001\; Van Dijk\, 2005\; García-Gómez\, 2011\; Paglieri
 \, 2013\; Díez-Prados & Cabrejas Peñuelas\, 2012\; Cabrejas-Peñuelas & 
 Díez-Prados\, 2013 and 2014).\n\nTherefore\, our proposal for this panel 
 is to analyze persuasion through the prism of evaluation\, as is reflected
  in the name of this panel: “At the crossroads of persuasion and evaluat
 ion/En la encrucijada entre persuasión y evaluación”.

DESCRIPTION:Interventions Organisation:\n\nIt follows from these introduct
 ory remarks:\n\nOn the one hand\, the speakers will be required to situate
  themselves in a field in one side while contrasting their positions with 
 others and from another side while exposing as much as possible the suppor
 ts that they might have found in the preceding models\, which they have la
 ter on given up.\n\nOn the other hand\, we will pair the participants in a
  way that will make them focus their contrasted and crossing attention onl
 y on problem setting or following distinct traditions/models. Moderating t
 hese face to face «collaborations» ensured by the DITECO network members
  should allow scholars to progress towards bringing together points of vie
 ws.\n\nOn which new bases can we maintain the Text/Discourse opposition?\n
 \nHow is it possible to make new descriptive categories by making the theo
 ries\, the domains or the currents interact? Starting from which new textu
 al and/or discursive categories can we make the already developed models c
 onverge without crossing each other?\n\nRegarding the fact that certain in
 strumental concepts have exhausted their heuristic value\, are the discipl
 inary meeting points capable of articulating knowledge that has not been a
  priori reconcilable\, apt to create their proper problem frames and to de
 fine new semiotic objects?\n\nHow can these comparisons between models reb
 uild differently other concepts which had imposed themselves in an era bef
 ore being used up and collapsing?\n\nAre the concepts a product of the tex
 tual or discursive practices\, and which rely essentially on the written\,
  and/or are transposable to the oral?\n\nRegarding progress in studies on 
 genericity made possible thanks to the digital: we will inquire whether th
 ese studies will not strengthen the utility of the textual approach withou
 t a discursive aspect?  How does the transition towards the digital\, towa
 rds the change of means and forms\, allow for the renewing of disciplines 
 and forging of new cultures\, through new significant practices?\n\nDo the
  possibilities offered by the automatic processing of language\, and parti
 cularly the technique of exploiting large corpora\, which refuse to view t
 he texts as small closed entities foster new alliances which allow the for
 ging of new operative concepts better adapted to their specificities?\n\nW
 e can also question the links between certain European models and their re
 instatement in Latin America\, with discourse analysis and semiotics. Sinc
 e these theories and their practices have their own history and particular
 ly abide by sociological and ideological constraints\, can these theoretic
 al filiations leave their imprints on each other in development of discour
 se and text analysis?\n\nRegistration Modalities:\n\nThe organising commit
 tee has fixed the following tariffs relative to the registration in the co
 nference:\n\n-    Full tariff: 140 euros\n-    Students tariff: 70 euros (

SUMMARY:Understanding Traditional & Mediated Service Encounters

DESCRIPTION:Service encounters are a pervasive and fundamental activity in
  everyday life whereby products\, information\, or commodities are traded 
 between a service provider and a service seeker. Due to their preponderanc
 e\, service encounters have been widely studied from a pragmatic point of 
 view (see among many others Economidou-Kogetsidis 2005\, Márquez Reiter 2
 004\; Placencia and Manceda-Rueda 2011). These studies have shown that the
  interaction between customer and\nservice provider is essential for the s
 uccess of the service encounter. Furthermore\, in the case of intercultura
 l service encounters\, studies have found that differences in what is cons
 idered appropriate communicative behavior - i.e. what (non)verbal actions 
 may be conducive to customer satisfaction - which may hinder the success o
 f the encounter (Blue and Harun 2003\,Callahan\, 2006). Although research 
 on service encounters has now a long standing tradition\n(Merrit 1976)\, t
 here is a pressing need for further research that focuses on the consequen
 ces of outsourcing and globalization on service encounters (Sifianou 2013)
  as well as on the impact that new technologies have had on this genre (Ga
 rcés-Conejos Blitvich forthcoming). In addition\, more research is needed
  to ascertain the evolution - if any - of the norms regulating verbal inte
 raction in different sub-types of the genre.\n\nTo further the understandi
 ng of verbal interaction in service encounters\, we are proposing a specia
 list panel for practitioners of pragmatics and related fields to present w
 ork on their latest research. The panel topic can be approached from diffe
 rent angles such as\, but not exclusively:\n\n- Outsourcing\, globalizatio
 n and service encounters.\n- Online service encounters. \n- Telephone serv
 ice encounters. \n- Intercultural service encounters. \n- (Im)politeness i
 n service encounters. \n- Conversational structure of service encounters. 
 \n- Negotiation in service encounters. \n- Receptionist-guest interactions
  at hotels. \n- Communication at information desks. \n- Corner-shop intera
 ctions. \n- Reception desks in medical consultations\,academic contexts\, 
 companies\, etc.

SUMMARY:Understanding Metonymy: Context and Cognition

DESCRIPTION:The cognitive turn in linguistics has brought forth new insigh
 ts into traditional tropes such as metaphor and metonymy. As in the case o
 f metaphor\, metonym has come to be seen as a ubiquitous cognitive phenome
 non reflected in language rather than an occasional witty or rhetorical pr
 ocess. Unlike the use of metaphor whose cognitive processing has been exte
 nsively studied from cognitive-pragmatic perspectives (Carston 2002\; Pilk
 ington 2000\; Sperber & Wilson 1986/1995\; Wilson 2003)\, however\, that o
 f metonymy has received relatively less attention\, leaving a lot of impor
 tant issues in need of adequate explanation. These issues mainly include t
 he following: i) In what context is a (referential) expression interpreted
  metonymically? ii) What kind of pragma-cognitive processes are involved i
 n assigning the metonymic interpretation? iii) What is the selective mecha
 nism in cases of competing candidate metonymic interpretations? iv) What i
 s the cognitive effect that ensues from the use of metonymy? v) To what ex
 tent are current models of interpretation pertaining to metonymy amenable 
 to empirical tests?\n\nThis panel will focus on\, while not limited to\, t
 hese major issues of metonymy research and seek to speculatively and empir
 ically tackle the explanatory power of the current theoretical models\, su
 ch as Gradient Salience Hypothesis by Giora (1997\, 2003)\, Relevance Theo
 ry by Sperber and Wilson (1986/1995) and Wilson and Sperber (2012)\, and M
 ental Space Theory and Blending Theory by Fauconnier (1994) and Fauconnier
  and Turner (2002)\, in hope of seeking new viable cognitive accounts of m
 etonymy used in context. A range of social-cognitive contextual factors su
 ch as lexical knowledge\, grammatical knowledge\, familiarity with metonym
 ic usages\, knowledge about the frequency of metonymic usages\, genre know
 ledge\, background assumptions\, knowledge of co-text\, and recognition of
  the current interactional goal will be explored and tested to reveal thei
 r possible effect on the interpretation of metonymy\, in terms of its cogn
 itive path\, pattern\, principle and predictability.\n\nAll the individual
  studies contributed to this panel will be conducted on the basis of authe
 ntic data from a variety of sources. Diverse methodology will be adopted a
 cross the panel\, including speculative theorizing\, qualitative analysis\
 , corpus-based analysis\, and various forms of experimental research like 
 eye tracking survey\, ERP study\, RP test\, event-related functional magne
 ticresonance imaging (fMRI) and think-aloud protocol.

DESCRIPTION:Perspective-Taking\n\nWorkshop organized as part of the Annual
  Conference of the German\nLinguistic Society (DGfS) to be held in Leipzig
 \, Germany\, March 4-6\, 2015\n(http://conference.uni-leipzig.de/dgfs2015/

 d}@uni-koeln.de\n\nInvited Speakers:\n\nBarbara Dancygier\, University of 
 British Columbia\nDale Barr\, University of Glasgow\n\nPragmatic theories 
 assign an important role to speakers and their intentions and beliefs. The
  perspective conveyed by a particular utterance impacts the interpretation
  of speaker meaning and it may even change the truth-values of an utteranc
 e (cf. e.g.\, Travis 1997). Theory of mind\, which accounts for the abilit
 y to attribute mental states to oneself or others\, and the notion of comm
 on ground think of perspective in a less restricted way. In language proce
 ssing\, the ability of shared mental states has been\ninvestigated with ad
 ults\, children and in language disorders like Asperger Syndrome. These st
 udies provide a first indication of the impact of perspective. Additionall
 y\, there are subtle variations in perspective in different pronominal for
 ms. In this regard\, typological research reveals\nintriguing effects of p
 erspective.\n\nThe workshop will focus on the phenomenon of perspective-ta
 king both from a processing and a theoretical view and address the followi
 ng questions:\n\n- Which aspects of perspective-taking are important for t
 he interlocutors to succeed in daily communication?\n- Which linguistic or
  general cognitive abilities are required to compute perspectival aspects 
 during language processing?\n-Are there default strategies that are adopte
 d during processing (cf. e.g.\, Keysar et al. 2000 on the priority of egoc
 entric perspective under certain conditions)?\n- Is perspective-taking a m
 arginal pragmatic phenomenon or a key aspect of human communication? \nHow
  is perspective expressed linguistically (e.g.\, demonstratives or logopho
 rs may convey specific perspective cues)?\n- Which distinctions are availa
 ble (e.g.\, self-/hearer-/other-directed speech\; self/source/pivot\; spea
 ker/location/thing as perspectival anchor)?\n- How should perspective be r
 epresented (i.e. as unarticulated constituents of the sentence or as commo
 n ground)?\n\nReferences:\n\nKeysar\, B.\, Barr\, D. J.\, Balin\, J. A.\,

DESCRIPTION:The panel organizers are part of a research group doing a cros
 s-linguistic exploration of strategies for reference-tracking that go beyo
 nd closed-class pronouns. The languages that the research group has consid
 ered exhibit reference-tracking strategies that are either underrepresente
 d or overlooked in the European languages that are the focus of much langu
 age description. On the one hand\, languages such as Dhivehi make extensiv
 e use of open-class nouns that denote kin or other social relations\, but 
 have anaphoric or exophoric reference (different from vocative function). 
 On the other\, languages such as Chinese permit zero anaphora in a wider r
 ange of syntactic contexts than would be predicted by Eurocentric models o
 f grammar. Languages such as Indonesian use both kinds of strategy\, and K
 orean adds to them speech level and honorific systems that narrow the sear
 ch space for identifying referents (as opposed to providing anaphors).\n\n
 A broadly typological perspective on reference tracking strategies--beyond
  closed-class pronouns--and their pragmalinguistic implications.  Represen
 tations of non-Indo-European languages are especially welcome.

DESCRIPTION:Language acquisition research on topics ranging from phonologi
 cal processing to semantic knowledge has been built on meticulous examinat
 ion of small data sets\, such as case studies. While we have learned a lot
  from such careful work\, some limitations quickly became evident. A new h
 orizon has opened as bigger\, open data sets began to emerge. Early exampl
 es are the CHILDES and the MCDI projects. Today\, new technologies pave th
 e way to some much needed cross-linguistic extensions\, for instance\, via
  automatic annotation of day-long audio(-video) recordings in seldom descr
 ibed languages. It also becomes possible to include other linguistic level
 s (e.g.\, receptive knowledge through open repositories of experimental re
 sults).\n\nThe present workshop will provide a platform for language acqui
 sition researchers to assess the progress towards high quality\, big\, and
  open data sets\, and to discuss solutions for current challenges. Researc
 hers who have collected large linguistic data sets from infants and childr
 en will share current insights and perspectives. In addition to presenting
  results from their own research\, they will discuss challenges (such as d
 ata standardization\, anonymization\, barriers to data sharing)\, and cons
 ider how to facilitate cross-linguistic extensions. Specialists in neighbo
 ring disciplines can gain some methodological and theoretical insights pot
 entially useful to their own work by learning about the state-of-the-art i
 n large-scale approaches to language acquisition.\n\nInvited Speaker:\n\nP

DESCRIPTION:The present day participative Internet\, Web 2.0\, is often co
 nceived as a space for the public exposure of one’s private life. This p
 anel aims to adopt another perspective on Web 2.0. The focus is on how use
 rs contribute to public discussions\, i.e.\, take part in the mediated pub
 lic sphere.  The internet and social media consist of spaces of digital ag
 ora where social actors cross and blur the boundaries between the public a
 nd private spheres\, institutions\, and everyday life.\n\nThe spaces in wh
 ich these socio-political digital discussions take place are\, for instanc
 e\, the blogosphere\, social networking sites (e.g.\, Facebook and Google 
 groups)\, content sharing sites (e.g.\, YouTube and Instagram)\, microblog
 ging sites (e.g.\, Twitter)\, various discussion forums\, and comment sect
 ions on news sites. The objective of this panel is to study various types 
 of online discussions and how they construct meaning in these digital spac
 es. For example\, comments on a politician’s blog may aim at expressing 
 support for the blog’s author while comment sections on news sites may c
 ontain posts mainly expressing the opinions of participants. Moreover\, so
 cietal topics on Facebook or Twitter make users engage in knowledge-constr
 ucting debates. Overall\, these discussions often contain disagreements or
  conflicts\; they may be moralistic or sarcastic\; yet they are also space
 s for supporting a cause or idolizing an individual. \n\nThe panel is open
  to various studies on the language use and discourse of socio-political o
 nline discussions. Possible objects of study include the following:\n\n- H
 ow do these discussions emerge\, evolve\, and end?\n- How interactive are 
 they? \n- Which basic language activities take place in these discussions?
  Are they\, for\, instance\, constructing or sharing knowledge\, supportin
 g or expressing ideas?\n- How do they mix public and private matters? How 
 do they contribute to the public sphere?\n- How do these discussions circu
 late\, recompose\, or remix themes\, discussions\, and texts from other pu
 blic spaces? \n- How do the participants express stance?\n- What kinds of 
 arguments are used?\n- Is “socio-political online discussion” a genre?
  What is the role of super and sub-genres\, and how is the embedding and m
 ixing of genres manifested?\n- How are multimodal and hypertextual feature
 s used in these discussions?

DESCRIPTION:Submissions are invited for a theme session at the 13th Intern
 ational Cognitive Linguistics Conference (ICLC-13)\, Newcastle (UK)\, July
  20-25\, 2015. \n\nTheories of “embodiment” in cognitive linguistics a
 nd related disciplines have led to major advances in the understanding of 
 linguistic meaning. A key claim is that the meanings of many linguistic un
 its correspond\, directly or through metaphorical extension\, to recurring
  patterns of sensorimotor experience or “image schemas”\, whose suscep
 tibility of visual and kinesthetic transformations in mental space also ac
 counts for synchronic and diachronic variation. Furthermore\, units at all
  levels of linguistic structure – including grammatical constructions 
 – are taken to be meaningful\, insofar as these can be described in term
 s of symbolic pairings of schematic phonological or syntactic forms and co
 nventionalized semantic or pragmatic meanings. However\, insights of the c
 ognitive interdiscipline have scarcely penetrated Greek and Latin linguist
 ics.

SUMMARY:Subtitling for the Deaf and the Hard-of-Hearing

DESCRIPTION:Subtitles for the Deaf and the Hard-of-Hearing\nCommunicating 
 oral speech through transient written words\nConference: 14th Internationa
 l Pragmatics Conference\n\nArticles 11 and 14 of the EU Charter of Fundame
 ntal Rights confirm access to information and education as basic human rig
 hts. The EU has recently adhered to the UN Convention on the  Rights of Pe
 ople with Disabilities. However\, still over 50 million of deaf or hard-of
 -hearing Europeans are deprived of basic human rights simply because they 
 cannot hear TV programs\,  cinema films or theatre plays. \n\nIn order to 
 cope with this problem\, the purpose of the panel is to gather professiona
 ls and scholars alike around the main theme of subtitling for the deaf and
  the hard-of-hearing (SDH). The focus of the conference being “adaptabil
 ity”\, the authors will ask participants to concentrate on two aspects o
 f SDH\, namely Multimodality (how are subtitles structured within the audi
 ovisual context they are added to) and Accessibility (how do subtitles fun
 ction for their audience). These two themes will be addressed from the poi
 nt of view of the producer (broadcasters\, access services\, subtitlers…
 )\; of the user or target audience (deaf\, hard-of-hearing\, and/or foreig
 n people)\; and of the researcher. \n\nPriority will be attributed to prop
 osals dealing with the abovementioned two aspects of SDH. Concerning multi
 modality\, TV\, DVD\, cinema\, theatre and conference subtitles will have 
 to be considered as a part of the multimodal text they are part of\, meani
 ng as just one of the communication units that compose a polysemiotic text
 . As for accessibility of deaf community to audiovisual contents of mass m
 edia products such as cinema movies\, TV broadcasts\, interventions will b
 e required to cover themes such as linguistic simplification\, facilitatio
 n\, inclusion into society of the community of deaf and hard-of-hearing pe
 ople\, and so on.\n\nPanel proponents: Prof. Franca Orletti\, Dr. Carlo Eu

SUMMARY:XXVIIIth Congress of the Canadian Association for Translation Stud

DESCRIPTION:This is the annual congress of the Canadian Association for Tr
 anslation Studies. This year's theme is ''Literary Translation and Canada.
 ''\n\nIn 1977\, Philip Stratford declared that although Canada did not yet
  have a literary translation ''tradition\,'' one could detect its stirring
 s\, especially since the launch of the Canada Arts Council grants. Nearly 
 forty years later\, it has become clear that a strong literary translation
  tradition does exist in Canada\, one which has played a key role in the N
 ation's identity. However\, translation as a means to bridge the ''two sol
 itudes'' has clearly become an outdated notion\, particularly when transla
 tion is viewed from a continental or global perspective.\n\nIndeed\, durin
 g the last decades\, a tendency towards diversification and internationali
 zation has permeated the borders of the translation polysystem. Not only h
 as the literary scene expanded thanks to a broader inclusion of emerging l
 iteratures -minority\, migrant\, regional\, First Nations\, and others-\, 
 but the variety of literary genres themselves has exploded. Moreover\, for
 eign authors are increasingly being translated in Canada\, and Canadian au
 thors themselves are being translated and exported. Hence\, the literary d
 ialogue between official languages has become a plural exchange\, which a 
 polyphony of voices have joined\, including minority languages\, as well a
 s First Nations languages of the Americas. This lends the literary and tra
 nslational capital of Canada a global scope. The new paradigm was concrete
 ly felt in 2003\, at the birth of the Banff International Literary Transla
 tion Centre.\n\nIn such a context\, it would appear reductive to approach 
 literary translation in Canada\, in being a preposition which confines to 
 a bounded territory\, and blocks the breadth of such an activity. The idea
  is rather to establish a relationship between literary translation and Ca
 nada −a conjunction in all senses− a relationship enabling us to view 
 translation as part of Canada's singularity\, a place of convergence and s
 ynthesis for various influences. Epistemologically\, Canada is a translati
 ng country within a translating continent\, the Americas. Canada can thus 
 be ''read'' as the heir to an intellectual tradition whose originality rel
 ies on translation. Translation Studies now offer frames of reference and 
 analysis favorable to the acknowledgement of the role literary translation
  has played in the hatching\, the survival and the redefinition of Canadia
 n identity (a moving one\, as everything that seeks to perpetuate itself).
  This year's conference\, then\, is an opportunity to provide an overview 
 of the present landscape and future perspectives of Literary Translation a
 nd Translation\, within Canada and abroad.

DESCRIPTION:While computational morphology is a respected and well-establi
 shed subfield of computational linguistics with important applications in 
 NLP\, this line of research has developed in parallel rather than in tight
  interaction with descriptive and theoretical morphology. This has led to 
 situations of mutual misunderstandings and missed opportunities. While the
  situation has improved over the last decade\, there is still room for muc
 h cross-fertilization among descriptive\, theoretical\, and computational 
 approaches to morphology.

  2015\n\nAn international conference including a one-day symposium on ‘I
 nterpreter training through the ages and into the future’\, on 23 June 2
 015.\n\nAlthough interpreting is as old as human contact\, its history has
  until recently remained marginalised. In the aftermath of mid-20th centur
 y warfare\, international war crimes trials created new venues and demand 
 for interpreting that have recently brought attention to the political and
  politicised nature of the role of translators and interpreters. However\,
  the presence of translators and interpreters at crucial moments in histor
 y is an area that demands further exploration: the work of these cross-cul
 tural communicators may create or resolve crisis and conflict\; translator
 s and interpreters are often also created by conflict\, in the sense that 
 individuals dislocated by colonisation\, war\, disasters or forced migrati
 on become those able to interpret and translate. Furthermore\, the trainin
 g and professionalization of these mediators\, emerging from an increasing
  recognition of the complexity of their role in such contexts\, also calls
  attention to the historical emergence of translation and interpreting as 
 an academic field of study.

 rovide a forum for discussion which reflects the most current and updated 
 research\, in order to promote and disseminate the constant changes and de
 velopments in the field of Translation and Interpreting\, both at academic
  and professional level. At this conference the real needs of translators 
 and interpreters\, the latest innovations\, and the most comprehensive stu
 dies on translation and interpreting of the 21st century will be discussed
  from the points of view of different fields of expertise.\n\nPrestigious 
 and internationally acclaimed academic lecturers such as Ruslan Mitkov (Un

DESCRIPTION:Theme:\n\nThe range of problems raised by diversity of languag
 es in international economic and political integration processes calls upo
 n innovative\, efficient and fair language policies to manage multilingual
 ism. Language policies are increasingly acknowledged as being a necessary 
 component of many decisions taken in the areas of labour mobility\, access
  to knowledge and higher education\, social inclusion of migrants\, and th
 ey can affect companies' international competitiveness and the democratic 
 control of international organisations.\n\nThe symposium ''Economics\, Lin
 guistic Justice and Language Policy'' aims at bringing together economists
 \, philosophers\, applied linguists and sociolinguists\, legal scholars\, 
 and social scientists in general. The purpose is to discuss\, from an inte
 rdisciplinary perspective\, the socio-economic effects of language policie
 s\, the impact of language dynamics and language planning on justice and i
 nequality at the national or international level\, as well as the connecti
 on between democracy\, decision-making and linguistic diversity. \n \nKeyn

SUMMARY:DGfS 2015 Workshop: What Drives Syntactic Computation? Alternative
 s to Formal Features
DTSTART;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20150304T000000
DTEND;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20150306T000000
UID:http://linguistlist.org/issues/25/25-2695.html
DESCRIPTION:Formal features (FFs) continue to figure prominently in variou
 s areas of syntactic theorizing. Displacement in particular is widely held
  to be effected by FFs or their properties (EPP\, discourse-related featur
 es\, etc.)\; External Merge\, too\, is commonly taken to satisfy featural 
 requirements. However\, various researchers have expressed skepticism towa
 rd this reliance on oftentimes arbitrary triggers  and the 'Last Resort' c
 haracter of syntactic computation in general (e.g.\, Chomsky 2001:6\, Fans
 elow 2006\, Zwart 2009)\, and some have sought more principled replacement
 s. This workshop aims to explore and assess such alternative approaches to
  the causal forces underlying syntactic operations and their effects on in
 terpretation and externalization.\n\nVarious lines of research have emerge
 d that all seek to minimize the role of featural triggers. Reinhart (1995\
 , 2006) argues that notions such as referentiality\, scope\, or focus cann
 ot be reduced to FFs\, despite their close association with syntactic oper
 ations (e.g.\, scrambling\, QR\, focus fronting). Instead\, these operatio
 ns are taken to apply freely in syntax\, with variable effects on interpre
 tation and externalization (see\, e.g.\, Fox 1999\, Szendroi 2001\, Neelem
 an & van de Koot 2008). Moro (2000\, 2004) and Ott (2012) argue that movem
 ent creates structural asymmetries required at the interfaces\, an approac
 h which Chomsky (2013) extends to the elusive 'EPP' and the vexing problem
  of intermediate movement steps. Even the traditional assumption that move
 ment of wh-phrases is triggered by corresponding FFs in the C-system has n
 ot gone unquestioned (Simik 2012).\n\nBorer's (1984) conjecture that param
 eters are exclusively expressed in terms of features of functional heads t
 raditionally assigns FFs a central role in linguistic variation. Deviating
  from this tradition\, some researchers now speculate that variation may b
 e restricted to the morphophonological (PF) component (e.g.\, Berwick & Ch
 omsky 2011). An illustration is provided by Richards (2010)\, who argues t
 hat the wh-movement parameter is derivative of the prosodic requirements o
 f wh-phrases and wh-questions in a given language\, which can be achieved 
 by either syntactic or prosodic means. As a result\, stipulations of 'feat
 ure strength' and the like become obsolete.\n\nBelow the word level\, fram
 eworks such as Nanosyntax likewise emphasize the role of morphophonology i
 n driving syntactic computation (Starke 2011). Sublexical movement is moti
 vated indirectly\, by the need to arrive at syntactic configurations for w
 hich there is a matching lexical item: what feature-based systems would ta
 ke to be a 'crashing' derivation here corresponds to the impossibility of 
 lexicalizing a syntactic subtree -- an independent output condition (cf. B
 obaljik & Thrainsson 1998 on V-raising).\n\nThese promising developments n
 otwithstanding\, featural triggers of syntactic operations continue to rei
 gn supreme in various domains of syntactic theory despite questionable exp
 lanatory success\; however\, in most cases more principled explanations ha
 ve yet to be articulated. This workshop will seek to explore the prospects
 \, scope and limits of alternative ways of motivating syntactic computatio
 n and locating crosslinguistic variability in natural language.\n\nInvited

SUMMARY:Indexicality and Social Meanings of Honorifics

DESCRIPTION:How we humans situate ourselves in relation to others\, how we
  address others\, speak of them\, and interact with them is linguistically
  transparent in any language\, though not always superficially obvious. Li
 nguistic forms across all human languages provide resources for such ways 
 of speaking and interacting\, e.g.\, (im)politely\, with or without defere
 nce\, signaling distance or solidarity or power\, affiliation or disaffili
 ation and so forth. This panel focuses on the use of honorifics in relatio
 n to their intended meanings and the honorifics systems in a number of the
  world's languages. It is widely accepted that the use of honorifics\, esp
 ecially in languages which have a grammatically encoded system\, is genera
 lly dictated by macro social factors such as age\, socioeconomic status\, 
 gender and so forth (Brown and Gilman 1960\, Sohn 1999\, Kim-Renaud 2009\,
  Kuno 1987\, Shibatani 1990). Recently\, however\, researchers have seriou
 sly questioned whether the use of honorifics is wholly dependent on the re
 lative status\, or some other factors (social\, psychological\, register- 
 and genre-dependent\, etc.) play a crucial role in the selection process (
 Cook 1996\, Strauss and Eun 2005\, Dunn 2005\, Brown 2011\, Lee and Cho 20
 13). These studies are mostly based on the framework of ''indexicality'' p
 roposed by Silverstein (1976)\, where he claims that there are various ''i
 ndexical-orders'' that work either at ''Micro'' level or at ''Macro'' leve
 l. While some studies\, especially in Japanese honorifics\, have dismissed
  the distinction between ''Micro'' and ''Macro'' levels and claim that fun
 ctions of honorifics such as 'formal'\, 'public'\, and 'polite' are one of
  meanings the honorific form indexes directly (Cook 1999)\, other studies 
 argue that ''Macro'' Indexing is clearly at work\, based on the observatio
 n that Korean adheres more rigidly to socially prescribed honorific forms 
 both in terms of address as well as in honorific language than Japanese (e
 .g.\, Lee and Cho 2013). These studies\, however\, have tended to look at 
 Japanese honorifics and Korean honorifics in isolation. To further investi
 gate how ''indexical-orders'' actually operate and what various social mea
 nings of honorifics are\, this panel calls for a cross-linguistic perspect
 ive where\, not only Japanese and Korean\, but also languages such as Fren
 ch\, Spanish\, and Persian (Aliakbari 2008) are systematically compared to
  uncover ''social meanings'' such as the speaker's social characteristics\
 , stance\, attributes\, and identities.\n\nThe aim of this panel is three-
 folds:\n\ni) To identify social meanings indexed by honorifics in both pub
 lic and private discourse data from several languages\nii) To investigate 
 if the distinction between ''Macro'' and ''Micro'' Indexicality is univers
 ally relevant to the use of honorifics\, and\niii) To reveal hitherto unkn
 own interactions between different honorific systems within a language (e.
 g.\, subject honorification vs. addressee honorification as these construc
 ts apply in Korean\, Japanese\, Spanish\, French\, and Persian.)

DESCRIPTION:Typology is the comparative study of linguistic systems. Just 
 like one can develop typologies of sound systems\, syntax\, and semantics\
 , so one can typologise pragmatic and conversational structure. This panel
  focuses on new methods\, concepts and findings in the domain of pragmatic
  typology: the comparative study of language use and the principles that s
 hape it. \n\nPragmatics has long had a comparative outlook\, and some of i
 ts important results have come from major cross-linguistic studies of poli
 teness (Brown and Levinson 1978) and speech acts such as requests and apol
 ogies (Blum-Kulka\, House\, and Kasper 1989). Recent developments in this 
 domain have been characterized by a renewed interest in the study of natur
 ally occurring face-to-face interaction\, resulting in an upsurge of compa
 rative research focusing on pragmatic phenomena in conversation (Ochs\, Sc
 hegloff\, and Thompson 1996\; Luke and Pavlidou 2002\; Enfield and Stivers
  2007\; Sidnell 2009\; Stivers et al. 2009\; Sidnell and Enfield 2012\; Zi
 nken and Ogiermann 2013\; Dingemanse\, Blythe\, and Dirksmeyer 2014\; Nuck
 olls and Michael 2014). Comparative work on pragmatics has grown to encomp
 ass a diverse set of methods and has already generated exciting new findin
 gs. \n\nThis panel aims to bring together international experts to discuss
  recent work in this emerging field\, with a special focus on fundamental 
 research questions and methods to address them. The growing availability o
 f rich records of language usage enables us to address long-standing quest
 ions\, but also to pose new ones. How general are proposed pragmatic unive
 rsals? How do the exigencies of conversation shape and constrain the evolu
 tion of linguistic systems? How are systems of language use inflected by d
 ifferences in the lexico-grammatical resources of typologically different 
 languages? If systems of language use form paradigms\, how are these parad
 igms to be compared across languages? How do different modes of social int
 eraction (e.g.\, technology-mediated forms of communication) influence lin
 guistic choices and pragmatic affordances?

DESCRIPTION:DGfS 2015 Leipzig - AG 2: Exact repetition in grammar and disc
 ourse\n\nOrganizers: Rita Finkbeiner (University of Mainz) & Ulrike Freywa
 ld (University of Potsdam)\n\nMost linguists will agree that iteration is 
 a pervasive phenomenon in language and an important notion for linguistic 
 analysis. Traditionally\, the process of repetition is related to the doma
 ins of text and discourse\, and associated with specific pragmatic effects
  (e.g.\, emphasis)\, while the process of reduplication is restricted to t
 he domains of phonology and morphology\, and associated with specific sema
 ntic effects (e.g.\, intensification). \n\nIn phonological and syntactic t
 heory\, reduplication has mainly been discussed as a local copying process
 \, while in typology\, it has been described as a morphological marker of 
 inflection or word formation. Repetition phenomena\, in contrast\, have be
 en claimed to apply above word level. In interactional linguistics\, the f
 ocus has been on functions of repetition such as marking of agreement and 
 disagreement.\n\nIn recent years\, however\, one has come to realize that 
 the borderline between reduplication and repetition is rather fuzzy (Stolz
  et al. 2011). For example\, in contrastive focus reduplication (e.g. sala
 d-salad 'prototypical salad')\, it is not quite clear whether we have to d
 o with a 'grammatical' or rather a 'pragmatic' process. Moreover\, while m
 ost European languages traditionally have been regarded as lacking redupli
 cation altogether\, there is now evidence that there are niches of product
 ive (total) reduplication also in alleged 'reduplication avoiders' such as
  German\, English\, and French (Finkbeiner 2014\, Freywald (in prep.)\, Ro
 ssi 2011).\n\nInvited Speakers:\n\nLaurence R. Horn\, Yale University\nTho

 \nOrganized by Walter Bisang (Mainz) & Balthasar Bickel (Zürich) & Gisber
 t Fanselow (Potsdam) & Hubert Haider (Salzburg)\n\nDescription of the Work
 shop:\n\nThe distinction between OV and VO order in a clause is usually ta
 ken to be a good predictor of further serialization facts\, and one can fi
 nd several proposals for an explanation of the corresponding implicative c
 orrelations in the literature. Possible further correlates of the VO-OV di
 stinction in domains other than word order such as the following have been
  investigated to a much lesser extent. The data represented in WALS shows 
 that the percentage of languages without a morphological system of case is
  lower among the OV languages. Likewise\, there are more OV than OV system
 s among the languages with an ergative case pattern\, while VO languages a
 re overrepresented among the languages which position question words at th
 e clause's left periphery. \n\nOther correlations have been proposed on th
 e basis of much smaller language samples. Thus\, it has been claimed that 
 free constituent order (scrambling) and the absence of typical subject-obj
 ect asymmetries are concomitant of OV order\, and it has been argued that 
 OV languages have a higher N:V ratio in the lexicon. There are interesting
  proposal as to how such correlations can be modeled in a theory of langua
 ge. \n\nInvited speakers are Mathew Dryer and Ad Neeleman.

DESCRIPTION:Corpus Methods in Cognitive Linguistics\nhttp://www.dsglynn.un
 iv-paris8.fr/cmcl_iclc.html \n\nThis is a call for submissions for a theme
  session at the International Conference of Cognitive Linguistics (ICLC-13
 \, 20-25 July 2015\, Newcastle\, UK).\n\nBuilding on the tradition develop
 ed by Dirven et al. (1982)\, Schmid (1993)\, Geeraerts et al. (1994) and G
 ries (2003)\, the theme session will focus on usage-based approaches in Co
 gnitive Linguistics. More specifically\, the session has two aims:\n\n1. D
 evelop corpus methods for attaining descriptive adequacy.\n2. Develop corp
 us methods for attaining explanatory adequacy.\n\n1. Description and Socia
 l Variation\n\nGiven the theoretical assumptions of the Cognitive Linguist
 ics model of language\, sociolinguistic variation is integral to structure
 . Therefore\, accounting for this complexity in language description is ne
 cessary for descriptive accuracy. This aim continues the line of research 
 represented in Dirven & Kristiansen (2008)\, Geeraerts et al. (2010)\, Pü
 tz et al. (2012)\, and Reif et al. (2013).\n\n2. Explanation and Hypothesi
 s Testing\n\nProposals such as (but not restricted to) prototype effects i
 n categorisation\, force dynamics in causation\, metaphor and metonymy in 
 conceptualisation\, frame semantic structuring of argument structure or gr
 ounding in construal are central to the paradigm of Cognitive Linguistics.
  These theories and those like them seek to explain how language productio
 n is possible. Examples of recent contributions in this line of research i
 nclude Gries & Stefanowitsch (2006)\, Stefanowitsch & Gries (2006)\, Glynn
  & Fischer (2010)\, Glynn & Robinson (2014).\n\nAlthough these two aims\, 
 description and explanation\, are inherently related\, the theme session h
 opes to highlight specifically their place in the development of corpus me
 thodology.

SUMMARY:Cognitive Perspectives on Linguistic Taboo

DESCRIPTION:We propose this theme session for ICLC 13 (Northumbria\, July 
 2015). It aims to bring together researchers working on topics related to 
 linguistic taboo (euphemism\, dysphemism\, taboo words\, etc.) from a Cogn
 itive Linguistics perspective. \n\nIn recent years\, a number of contribut
 ions have underlined the social and the cognitive nature of taboo phenomen
 a (Casas Gómez\, 2009\; Crespo Fernández\, 2008\; Chamizo Domínguez\, 2
 004\, 2009). This has led to a renewed interest in defining and theorizing
  about the domain’s core concepts (interdiction\, taboo\, euphemism\, dy
 sphemism\, etc.). We believe that bringing together the scattered voices w
 ould contribute to the coherence and cohesion of the field. Likewise\, it 
 will breathe air into this new generation of studies of linguistic taboo.\
 n\nWe advocate for a maximalist theory of meaning\, as is usual in Cogniti
 ve Linguistics (Cuyckens et al.\, 2009\; Geeraerts\; 2006). Specifically\,
  we aim at reflecting on a new\, non-essencialist framework for linguistic
  taboo and related phenomena that takes into account its social and cognit
 ive facets. We ask contributors to support their theoretical reflections w
 ith empirical analyses of written or spoken data (synchronic or diachronic
 \, but preferably quantitative and multifactorial).\n\nWe encourage papers
  on the following topics:\n\n- Linguistic taboo and prototype theory: at t
 he semasiological level\, what constitutes a taboo category? How taboo (or
  how central) are certain taboo concepts/words? At the onomasiological lev
 el\, how fuzzy are the limits of taboo categories? How salient are the exp
 ressions for a certain taboo concept? (see Geeraerts et al.\, 1994)\n\n- E
 mbodiment and Cultural Conceptualisation of Taboo: What is the role of emb
 odiment in the conceptualisation of certain taboos (sex\, physiology\, ill
 ness)? How do cultural models of the body affect linguistic taboo? How do 
 taboos vary among cultural groups and what role do they play? (see Lakoff\
 , 1987\; Sharifian\, 2011\; etc.)\n\n- Construal of taboo concepts (Cognit
 ive Metaphor\, Cognitive Metonymy\, vagueness…): What linguistic mechani
 sms participate in the expression of taboo concepts? How productive are th
 ey in the expression of taboo concepts? What source domains are more frequ
 ent? Are some taboo concepts more prone to be construed through metaphor/m
 etonymy? (see Allan y Burridge\, 1991\; Crespo Fernández\, 2008\; Lakoff 
 & Johnson\, 2013\; etc.)\n\n- Cognitive Sociolinguistics of Linguistic Tab
 oo: what external factors affect the variation of taboo concepts? How do l
 inguistic and external factors interfere in the variation of taboo concept
 s? Can traditional assumptions on the use of taboo be confirmed (preferenc
 es of men vs. women\, young vs. old\, etc.)? Are there patterns of variati
 on? (see Geeraerts\, et al.\, 2010\; Kristiansen & Dirven\, 2008\; Pizarro
  Pedraza\, 2013).\n\n- Cognitive Pragmatics and Linguistic Taboo: What ele
 ments of the pragmatic situation affect the production/reception of taboo 
 concepts? What functions does taboo have in interpersonal communication? H
 ow is taboo related to pragmatic competence? (see Jay\, 2000\; Jay & Jansh
 ewitz\, 2008)\n\n- Methodologies: Can Cognitive Linguistics’ methods be 
 applied to the study of linguistic taboo? What are the problems of working
  with available corpora? From a Cognitive Sociolinguistic perspective\, ho
 w to deal with taboo data collection? How to deal with ethics? What are th
 e problems of setting up an experiment about taboo topics?

DESCRIPTION:Typological research indicates that many languages share speci
 fic patterns regarding their phoneme inventories\, syllable structures\, p
 honotactics and prosodic systems. A recurrent topic in acquisition researc
 h is the question of whether typologically well-attested patterns reflect 
 universal biases on phonological acquisition and/or speech processing. Thi
 s workshop aims at discussing the nature of these biases and to what exten
 t they influence phonological acquisition and processing of L1 and L2 in c
 hildren and adults.\n\nThere seems to be a strong consensus among research
 ers that phonological acquisition is guided by universal biases. Yet\, the
  specific nature of these biases is unclear: are they functional or analyt
 ical\, domain-general or domain-specific? What is it that makes some patte
 rns\, often called natural patterns\, more easily accessible and learnable
  than others: Are they are innate or are they triggered by experience with
  language? In addition\, it is debated whether there are time limits on th
 e operating periods of biases (possibly reflecting difficulties in L2 phon
 ological acquisition\, i.e.\, a critical period)\, or whether they also in
 fluence L2 phonological acquisition. If they influence the L2\, what happe
 ns when the L1 phonological system is in conflict with the L2? In addition
 \, the question arises to what extent universal biases might be at work ev
 en during speech processing after acquisition is completed. These classica
 l questions have recently received new attention and benefit from the revi
 val of artificial language paradigms\, which enable us to investigate lang
 uage acquisition and processing likewise.\n\nThe goal of the workshop is t
 o discuss effects of biases on L1 and early L2 phonological acquisition an
 d their relation to age of acquisition from theoretical and empirical pers
 pective. We aim to contribute to the current debate by assembling new insi
 ghts to get a more concrete comprehension of the nature of universal biase
 s. \n\nKeynote Speakers:\n\nSharon Peperkamp (CNRS\, Institut d'Etudes de

DESCRIPTION:For ICLC 13 (Northumbria\, July 2015) we propose a theme sessi
 on that aims to demonstrate the benefits and possibilities of Cognitive Co
 ntact Linguistics (CCL)\, a framework that imbeds core concepts and theore
 tical insights of Cognitive Linguistics and Cognitive Sociolinguistics in 
 research on contact-induced variation and change.\n\nTheoretically\, turni
 ng to given concepts in Cognitive Linguistics will improve the existing ta
 xonomies and definitions in contact linguistics\, and will increase our un
 derstanding of contact-induced phenomena such as borrowing and codeswitchi
 ng. More specifically:\n\n1) Prototype theory (e.g. Geeraerts et al. 1994)
  can be used to advance the debate on the distinction between codeswitchin
 g and borrowing\, by letting go of the desire for a classical definition o
 f both concepts in favor of a prototypical approach\, in which the fuzzy b
 oundaries between the two concepts are accepted as part of the linguistic 
 reality (e.g. Matras 2009: 113-114)\n\n2) Insights from Construction Gramm
 ar (e.g. Langacker 1991\, Goldberg 1995) can help unify research tradition
 s on lexical borrowing (with its typically narrow focus on single word uni
 ts)\, codeswitching (with its strictly synchronic focus)\, and structural 
 borrowing (with its focus on grammar only) by introducing the idea of a co
 ntinuum from lexicon to syntax (e.g. Doğruöz & Backus 2009\, cp. Heine &
  Kuteva 2005)\n\n3) The notions of entrenchment and salience (e.g. Schmid 
 2007) can increase our understanding of variation in borrowability in gene
 ral and of the crucial role that is played by semantic\, pragmatic and soc
 ial meaning in promoting the attractiveness of particular forms from anoth
 er language. In this respect\, insisting on the distinction between semasi
 ology and onomasiology (e.g. Geeraerts 1997) proves crucial (e.g. Zenner e
 t al. 2014a\; Winter-Froemel 2013).\n\n4) Conceptual Metaphors and Cultura
 l Models (e.g. Lakoff & Johnson 1980) provide objective descriptions of (i
 nter)cultural differences\, both within and between contact varieties (e.g
 . Wolf & Polzenhagen 2009)\n\n5) Usage-based re-formulations of known issu
 es in historical linguistics effectuate a re-appraisal of contact linguist
 ic puzzles in historical linguistic terms (Backus 2013 on the actuation/in
 novation and transition/propagation problem) (Weinreich et al. 1968 vs. Cr
 oft 2000)\n\nIn addition to these theoretical perspectives\, CCL methodolo
 gically relies on Cognitive Sociolinguistics in emphasizing that any usage
 -based analysis should be based on empirical data (Kristiansen & Dirven 20
 08). Given how contact communities are by default heterogeneous (i.e. bi- 
 or multilingual)\, any such empirical analysis conducted in a contact sett
 ing should include a variationist component. Adding that a speech communit
 y is often heterogeneous in more than one respect (e.g. regarding region o
 r register)\, a truly variationist analysis will also be multifactorial: t
 he effect of more than one independent variable on the contact-induced phe
 nomenon under scrutiny is patterned. Resulting\, inferential statistical a
 nalyses should be used in order to deal with the ensuing complexity of the
  resulting dataset. An example of such an approach in contact linguistics 
 can be found in Zenner et al. (2014b)\, where a multifactorial statistical
  model is used to explain variation in the use of expressive English loanw
 ords in Dutch.\n\nConvenors:\n\nEline Zenner (KU Leuven)\nA. Seza Doğruö

 l be co-located with the 17th Diachronic Generative Syntax Conference (DiG
 S 17) which will be held 29-31 May 2015. The meeting aims to follow up on 
 the success of FWAV1 which was held in Reykjavík in 2012.\n\nThe FWAV wor
 kshop is a venue for research that relates linguistic variation and formal
  analysis. FWAV is not restricted to specific domains such as syntax or ph
 onology. The general theme of the meeting is described below. This year\, 
 FWAV will be co-located with DiGS 17 and on this occasion we hope some of 
 the presentations at FWAV will make use of the various historical treebank
 s that are familiar to many researchers in diachronic syntax.\n\nLabov’s
  pioneering study on contraction and deletion of the copula in African Ame
 rican Vernacular English (1969) and subsequent work on linguistic variatio
 n and change has drawn substantial attention to the relationship between f
 ormal analysis and quantitative usage patterns. Recently available evidenc
 e shows that discrete acceptability judgments in syntax\, drawn from a lar
 ge sample of speakers\, also manifest regular quantitative patterns (see e
 .g. Thráinsson et al. 2013 and references cited there).

DESCRIPTION:Proposal for a workshop at the 13th International Cognitive Li
 nguistics Conference (ICLC-13)\, Northumbria University\, Newcastle-upon-T
 yne\, 20-25 July 2015\n\nYoshikata Shibuya (Kyoto University of Foreign St
 udies)\, Kim Ebensgaard Jensen (Aalborg University)\, Willem B. Hollmann (
 Lancaster University)\, Naoki Kiyama (Osaka University)\n\nExploring Adjec
 tives: With Special Focus on their Grammar\, Meaning and Sound\n\nOver the
  last few decades\, the field of linguistics has witnessed a shift from th
 e so-called the dictionary-and-grammar model (Taylor 2012: 8) to a view wh
 ere knowledge of language is assumed to be knowledge of constructions and 
 a construction is defined as a form-meaning pair (Goldberg 2003). The fund
 amental theoretical assumptions cherished in constructionist approaches 
 – including the syntax-lexicon continuum hypothesis – have allowed res
 earchers to explore a wide range of topics (e.g. idioms\, argument structu
 re constructions\, constructional morphology\, pragmatic properties of con
 structions\, language change and variation). Despite the diversity in the 
 topics dealt with by construction grammarians\, the majority of research s
 till has had a tendency to focus on verbs and related issues such as tense
 \, aspect\, modality\, voice and/or sentence structures. In this workshop\
 , we pay special attention to a relatively untouched (from the point of vi
 ew of constructions) domain\, namely adjectives. Using modern empirical me
 thods (including corpus data) from the perspective of construction grammar
 /cognitive linguistics\, we endeavor to provide a new insight into the stu
 dy of adjectives.

SUMMARY:Strong Versus Weak Prosodic Positions: Possible Variation and Rele

DESCRIPTION:The workshop is part of the 37th annual conference of the Germ
 an Linguistics Society (DGfS) which will take place at the University of L
 eipzig from March 4-6\, 2015.\n\nWorkshop Convenors:\n\nRenate Raffelsiefe
 n (IDS Mannheim/FU Berlin) & Marzena Żygis (ZAS Berlin/HU\nBerlin)\n\nBot
 h phoneticians and phonologists have found reason to distinguish 'strong' 
 and 'weak' positions referring to constituents of the prosodic hierarchy\,
  including higher constituents\, whose boundaries align with morphosyntact
 ic boundaries\, as well as lower constituents such as foot and syllable. S
 trength is commonly associated with initial positions and with stress wher
 eas weakness is associated with non-prominent positions. Reference to stro
 ng versus weak positions has been invoked in articulatory phonetics (targe
 t overshoot\, i.e. enhancement of the duration and/or magnitude of articul
 atory gestures\, in strong positions versus target undershoot in weak posi
 tion) as well as auditory phonetics (lower rate of misperception in strong
  positions versus higher rate in weak position). It has also been invoked 
 to account for potential contrast\, more distinctiveness being associated 
 with strong positions (cf. the notions of 'positional faithfulness' and 'p
 ositional markedness' in Optimality Theory). Although reference to 'strong
 ' versus 'weak' positions appears to be universally grounded in prominence
  and although it seems to be taken for granted that positions considered s
 trong for the purpose of one area of phonetics or phonology implies streng
 th for the purpose of others there is evidence for disparity. For instance
 \, the word-initial position is associated with strong potential contrast 
 by Beckman (1998)\, whereas Trubezkoy links both margin positions of words
  to low contrastiveness (e.g. neutralization of the voicing contrast for a
 ll consonants in word-initial position in Erza-Mordwin\, Trubetzkoy 1958: 
 212ff). Similarly\, the word-initial position is associated with target ov
 ershoot (e.g. aspiration of voiceless plosives) in English or German\, but
  also exhibits fewer contrasts in fricatives than for instance the foot-in
 ternal position. The latter nonetheless exhibits target undershoot (flappi
 ng in American English). \n\nInvited Speakers:\n\nRachel Walker\, Universi

 ucators face continually shifting demands from all directions: students\, 
 administrators\, and society. With some of these demands\, teachers and le

 n the disaggregation of the university or in frequent testing of discrete

 ve Language: linguistic\, cultural\, philosophical\, psychological and com
 putational perspectives\n\nCommunication is replete with figurative langua
 ge\, such as metaphor or metonymy\, and people use such language in a vari
 ety of contexts and with a range of effects. There are important open ques
 tions as to why and how speakers come to speak figuratively in any given i
 nstance and what governs their particular choices of conceptual metaphors\
 , figurative phraseology\, etc\, and indeed how (un)conscious or (un)delib
 erate such choices can be. Implicit in these questions are issues about th
 e explanatory\, obfuscatory\, affective and social functions of figurative
  language. \n\nFor a phenomena as central to our lives as figurative langu
 age\, how it is produced should be a priority within the cognitive science
 s\, one would think. Indeed\, work on the production of figurative languag
 e has been carried out in areas as diverse as developmental studies (Winne
 r 1997)\, psycholinguistics (Chiappe & Kennedy 2001)\, language learning (
 Deignan et al. 1997\, Littlemore 2009)\, neurolinguistics (Benedek et al. 
 2014)\, communication and performance studies (Gibbs & Cameron 2008)\, nat
 ural language generation (e.g. Martin 1988\, Su & Zhou 2005\, Veale & Hao 
 2007\, Gargett & Barnden 2014).  Yet\, much less research has been devoted
  to the production of such language compared to research on how it is unde
 rstood.\n\nPlease see call for papers for more details about aims\, object
 ives\, etc\, of symposium.\n\nImportant Note:\n\nOur accepting your submis

 \nJohn Baugh\, Washington University \n\nTALE and LSA sponsor a joint symp

 \, Esq. will present the legal perspective on expertise: various roles of 
 experts (consulting\, testifying) and the Frye and Daubert standards for a
 dmissible testimony. This talk will provide the audience with a good idea 
 of what an expert is expected to do\, with integrity\, in the forensic set
 ting. The major rulings that have admitted or not admitted linguistic evid
 ence are reviewed.\n\nCarole E. Chaski will present three approaches to fo
 rensic linguistics as linguistics and applied linguistics\, focusing on ho
 w methods in linguistics get translated into a forensic application. These
  three approaches are (i) immediate and direct application of a standard l
 inguistics method\; (ii) building a method specifically for a forensic iss
 ue using standard methods in linguistics\; and (iii) defending linguistics
  in forensic linguistics when the linguistic analysis is either applied in
 correctly or not actually a method based in linguistics. The next three ta
 lks will illustrate each of these approaches to expertise in forensic ling
 uistics.\n\nKeith Walters will present his work on cases involving English
 -Only workplace rules. Walters will show how current research in linguisti
 cs has an immediate and direct application to the analysis of language in 
 these cases. Walters will illustrate the role of both the consulting and t
 estifying experts.\n\nCarole E. Chaski\, Seung-Man Kang\, Angela Almela\, 
 and Abdesalam Soudi will present their work building a method specifically
  for a forensic issue using standard methods in linguistics. Chaski et al 
 report on building a method for forensic authorship identification using s
 tandard syntactic analysis and corpus and computational linguistics\, cros
 s-linguistically. This work extends ALIAS\, a system of software tools for
  forensic linguistic analysis based on methods in corpus and computational
  linguistics\, syntax and semantics\, and in particular the SynAID\, a mod
 ule for authorship identification (Chaski 1997\, 2001\, 2005\, 2007). Expe
 rt testimony using SynAID has been admitted in Federal and State trials un
 der both the Frye and Daubert standards\, ALIAS SynAID has been validated 
 in English\, with an accuracy rate of 95%\, and now we are working to deve
 lop these tools in other languages\, such as Korean\, Spanish and Arabic. 
 \n\nJohn Baugh will present his work as an expert defending linguistics in
  forensic linguistics when the linguistic analysis is either applied incor
 rectly or not actually a method based in linguistics. Because non-linguist
 s have proffered forensic linguistics and sometimes linguists have relied 
 on non-linguistics-based models of language\, the expert linguist must als
 o be ready to defend linguistics and clarify what linguistics is in the fo
 rensic setting. Baugh will focus on linguistic profiling as linguistic evi
 dence in various types of civil and criminal cases.

SUMMARY:From Pragmatism to Pragmatics

DESCRIPTION:The purpose of the panel “From Pragmatism to Pragmatics” i
 s to investigate the historical and theoretical connections between pragma
 tism and pragmatics.\n\nBuilding on Charles S. Peirce’s theory of signs 
 (semiotics)\, Charles Morris famously divided the study of language into s
 yntactics\, semantics\, and pragmatics\, and defined pragmatics as the stu
 dy of the relation of signs to interpreters. Carnap adopted Morris’ tric
 hotomy and popularized it in philosophy. Later Morris described pragmatics
  as the study of the origin\, use and effects of signs. Although Morris’
 s and Carnap’s divisions cannot be exactly mapped onto Peirce’s divisi
 on of semiotics into speculative grammar\, critic\, and speculative rhetor
 ic\, yet it has been shown that Peirce himself already formulated a speech
 -act theory ante litteram. \n\nBut this is only where the story begins. Pa
 ul Grice’s archives (Bancroft Library\, Berkeley) contain striking testi
 mony that not only did Grice know about Peirce but also that around mid-19
 50s he wrote a full set of lecture notes entitled “Peirce’s Theory of 
 Signs”. His account of meaning developed\, at least in part\, from his r
 eaction to Peirce. \n\nThe manifold connections\, both historical and theo
 retical\, between pragmatism (Peirce\, Morris etc.) and classical and cont
 emporary pragmatics are still to be explored in full. The aim of the propo
 sed panel is to identify new historical sources of pragmatics\, to documen
 t the influence that earlier theories of signs\, meaning and language exer
 cised upon its emergence\, and to reflect on the historical and epistemolo
 gical status of pragmatics. The proposed panel and its papers thus contrib
 ute to the investigation of a pragmatic\, and not merely the “semantic
 ” tradition (Coffa) in the relevant histories of philosophy of language 
 and pragmatics.

DESCRIPTION:The panel 'Pragmatic perspectives on networked L2 discourse' w
 ill examine and discuss the interplay between structural choice\, function
  and context in the practice of interactional second/foreign language (L2)
  use in Web 2.0\, the second-generation web. Web 2.0 has dramatically chan
 ged L2 practice. By connecting people\, Web 2.0 facilitates multilingual e
 ncounters in virtual community spaces where people can interact with other
 s in the language(s) of their choice. \n\nIn spite of the research interes
 t in computer-mediated communication\, L2 linguistic practices have receiv
 ed relatively little attention for two main reasons. First of all\, the va
 st majority of linguistic research on computer-mediated communication (CMC
 ) draws on first-language (L1) data (for notable exceptions\, see e.g.\, A
 ndroutsopoulos\, 2007\; Warschauer & De Florio-Hansen\, 2003). Secondly\, 
 investigations of L2 CMC data generally take a pedagogical rather than a l
 inguistic perspective. Often\, such research is more concerned with what L
 2 users can do rather than with what they actually do\, i.e.\, more with a
 ffordances for L2 learning than with L2 practice. Seeking to bridge the ga
 p between these two CMC research strands\, this panel hopes to advance the
  linguistic study of networked L2 discourse.

DESCRIPTION:After the successful first conference in Denmark in 2013\, the
  University of Groningen will host the second conference on 'Thinking\, Do
 ing\, Learning: Usage-based Perspectives on Second Language Learning' (TDL
 2) from June 3-5\, 2015 in Groningen\, the Netherlands. Registration is no
 w open!\n\nThe field of second language (L2) learning research has come to
  sustain a multitude of perspectives on language and learning but also on 
 broader issues such as the crossing points between sociality\, the nature 
 of human interaction\, and individual cognition. Along with this great the
 oretical\, methodological and empirical variety comes an expansion of what
  is traditionally thought of as the core of language and the nature of lea
 rning.\n\nThis conference brings together perspectives that find mutual ki
 nship in a view of language as an embodied\, semiotic\, symbolic tool used
  for communicative and interactional purposes and an understanding of lang
 uage use as the preeminent condition for language learning – perspective
 s that we conjoin under the umbrella term of usage based perspectives.\n\n
 Such perspectives yield a wide variety of questions to be answered – fro
 m societal issues of what it means to interact in an L2 to how speakers ca
 rry out social\, sense-making moment-to-moment activities\, and from the e
 nvironments of language use and learning to the nature of the sediments of
  these usage events that are left as “acquired linguistic constructions
 ” in the individual language learner.\n\nThe conference will promote and
  advance this multitude of theoretical and methodological perspectives in 
 second language learning research.\n\nKeynote Speakers:\n\nTeresa Cadierno
 \nWander Lowie\nSimona Pekarek Doehler\nSteve Thorne\n\nInvited Colloquium

SUMMARY:The Determinants of Diachronic Stability
DTSTART;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20160628T000000
DTEND;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20160628T000000

DESCRIPTION:That human languages are constantly evolving is an undeniable 
 fact. By now\, theories have become very apt at dealing with linguistic va
 riation and change. But the reality is that populations are in constant fl
 ux\, socially and linguistically. Much of what used to be considered “in
 ternally caused change” might perhaps more appropriately have to be cons
 idered as contact-induced on the level of contact between varieties of a s
 ingle diasystem. This realization turns the faithful stable transmission o
 f linguistic features where it does occur into an urgent explanandum. Diff
 erent linguistic subfields have responded to this in different ways\, and 
 many questions still need to be addressed.\n\n- Within the field of typolo
 gy\, the question of diachronically and cross-linguistically more stable t
 raits of languages has been put on the agenda mainly by the work of Johann
 a Nichols (e.g. Nichols 1992).\n- From a markedness point of view\, inflec
 tional classes apparently needlessly complicate morphological systems and 
 lead to the expectation that they should be diachronically unstable (e.g. 
 Wurzel 1989). The fact that this is empirically not confirmed is in need o
 f explanation (e.g. Lass 1990).\n- While there is no question that languag
 e contact may induce change (e.g. Thomason & Kaufman 1988)\, it has only m
 ore recently been noted that there may also be linguistic stability in spi
 te of language contact\, and that it may\, in some cases\, even be contact
 -induced (e.g. Trudgill 2011\, Braunmüller et al. eds. 2014). \n- A furth
 er question that has not yet satisfyingly been answered is why\, given the
  same or similar input conditions in different languages\, some linguistic
  changes never happen\, or\, once initiated\, stall (e.g. Weinreich\, Labo
 v & Herzog 1968\, Labov 1994\; 2001). \n- More recently\, the related ques
 tion of whether there can be such a thing as stable variation in language\
 , and how it interacts with language change has been added to the research
  agenda (e.g. Wallenberg 2013\, Fruehwald & Wallenberg 2013). \n- It is un
 clear what the influence of type and token frequency is on keeping certain
  properties diachronically stable. On the one hand\, research on grammatic
 alization has indicated that highly frequent items are more likely to gram
 maticalize\, and therefore\, low frequency of usage might be expected to f
 avour stability. On the other hand\, highly frequent elements often resist
  analogical change\, so in this sense\, ‘low frequency items’ are expe
 cted to be more prone to change.\n- Finally\, the role of extra-linguistic
  factors such as normative pressure in keeping linguistic phenomena consta
 nt should be studied more systematically\, and with an eye on interaction 
 with the language internal factors mentioned above.\n\nThe workshop will b
 e held at Ghent University\, on 28 June 2016. Its goal is to bring togethe
 r researchers from different areas of linguistics to discuss the determina
 nts of diachronic stability from their individual perspectives\, with the 
 aim of fostering dialogue between them. \n\nKeynote Speakers:\n\n- Sheila 
 Watts (Cambridge)\n- Joel C. Wallenberg (Newcastle)

DESCRIPTION:Working Panel Abstract:\n\nAlthough the academic study of spor
 t and its intersections with national identity politics\, colonial legacie
 s\, gender relations\, and commercialization has grown in the fields of so
 ciology\, anthropology\, and economics\, especially in the last 20 to 30 y
 ears\, the study of sport within sociolinguistics remains underdeveloped. 
 This panel strives to advance critical sociolinguistic reflection on langu
 age and discourse in sport\, within the complex conditions of the globaliz
 ing economy and mobility.\n\nStarting from the assumption that circulating
  communicative resources (e.g. dialects\, registers\, styles\, multilingua
 lisms)\, mobile discourses (of the nation\, the body\, tokens of authentic
 ity\, etc.)\, as well as moving bodies (of sports workers\, media personne
 l\, agents and fans) are key resources of globalizing sport industries\, t
 his panel will raise the following questions: \n\na) What is the status of
  mobile languages\, discourses and bodies within the framework of a transn
 ational sports industry? i.e.\, How does the professional sports economy i
 nvest in these resources? For whom? For what purposes?\n\nb) What are cons
 idered prestigious languages\, discourses and bodies within local and glob
 alizing sport economies? i.e.\, Who gets to produce\, circulate and consum
 e these resources in which commercial sports markets? Under what condition
 s?\n\nc) What tokens of expertise are mobilized to legitimize and authoriz
 e the forms of difference and inequality (re)produced by the sports indust
 ries' investment in language\, discourse and mobility?\n\nBy exploring pro
 fessional sport as a nexus where attitudes or ideologies of language\, loc
 alism\, (trans)nationalism\, migration\, gender\, the body\, labor\, and p
 rofit intersect\, this panel will gather sociolinguists and ethnographers 
 working on different sectors of the sports economy to investigate how athl
 etes\, their commodifiers and their consumers negotiate relations of prest
 ige and power.

 my in Verona\, Italy 24-27 June 2015.\n\nIn the concluding paper by Elwys 
 De Stefani at NITE IV in Turku there were some suggestions of topics for c
 ontinuing the series of the International Symposium about Names in the Eco
 nomy. The proposal was a stimulation to widen the perspectives from the co
 mmercial names to a language for and in the economy. We therefore suggest 
 as the subject of the conference: Language\, Media & Economy in Virtual an
 d Real life: New Perspectives.\n\nThe conference will focus on corpus and 
 data collections\, on the methodology for searching the data bases\, on me
 thods and approaches to describe and analyse the multimedial channels in t
 he economy\, considering not only commercial\, proper and common names in 
 everyday settings and in virtual life settings. In the globalized world\, 
 a company may spread its message to every corner of the globe with a few b
 road strokes and reach the customers around the clock by utilizing multime
 dia advertising. These media outlets can include\, but are not limited to\
 , television\, radio\, newspapers\, magazines\, internet websites and mobi
 le digital devices. It could be very interesting to compare both the lingu
 istic and the marketing perspectives in creating and conducting a multimed
 ia campaign\, to observe how the different levels (language\, music\, imag
 ery) interplay in communicating the message. Nevertheless\, branding remai
 ns one of the crucial elements of modern advertising\, since knowledge of 
 a company's brand is often one of the most important factors in the decisi
 on-making process of consumers. \n\nThe conference languages are English\,
  French\, German\, Italian.

 One of the Forum's strategies for developing useful discussions is to orga
 nize the conferences around specific topics within phonology\, and to invi
 te and encourage participation from scholars who look at each topic from a
  variety of perspectives. This year's topic will explore formal\, function
 al\, experimental\, and computational approaches to the topic of multiling

DESCRIPTION:People are known to understand\, memorise and parse words in a
  context-sensitive\, opportunistic way\, by caching their most habitual an
 d productive processing patterns into routinized behavioural schemes\, sim
 ilarly to what we observe for sequences of coordinated motor acts. Speaker
 s\, however\, do not only take advantage of token-based information such a
 s frequency of individual\, holistically stored words\, or episodic memori
 es of word usage\, but they are also able to organise stored word forms th
 rough abstract paradigmatic structures (or word families) whose overall si
 ze and distribution are important determinants of lexical categorisation\,
  inference and productivity. Contrary to traditional wisdom\, epitomised b
 y the so-called ''calculator metaphor''\, lexical organisation is not nece
 ssarily functional to descriptive economy and minimisation of storage\, bu
 t appears to be influenced by more dynamic\, communication-oriented functi
 ons such as memorisation\, prediction-based recognition and production.\n\
 nLending support to this view\, usage-based approaches to word processing 
 have recently offered novel explanatory frameworks that capitalise on stab
 le correlation patterns between lexical representations on the one hand an
 d process-based operations that make representations functional to communi
 cative exchanges on the other hand. By focusing on the battery of low-leve
 l cognitive functions supporting verbal communication (ranging from serial
  encoding\, rehearsal and storage to access\, recall\, integration\, co-ac
 tivation and selection) and by exploring the psycholinguistic correlates a
 nd neuroanatomical substrates of higher-level communicative functions (rec
 ognition\, analysis and production)\, these approaches promote a new view 
 of language architecture as an emergent property of the interaction betwee
 n language-specific input conditions and (possibly domain-specific) cognit
 ive predispositions.

 tural language processing\, linguistics\, or digital humanities\, are also
  relevant topics.\n\nThe fourth edition of SFCM in 2015 will bring togethe
 r communities involved with the study of morphology. SFCM 2015 will focus 
 on computational approaches to theoretical and descriptive morphology. It 
 will broaden the workshop's scope by addressing computational linguists wo
 rking on computational morphology\, linguists from theoretical morphology\
 , and field linguists working on rich morphological data using computation

DESCRIPTION:Trið råðstemną um övdalskų (Third Conference on Elfdalia
 n) will take place on 7-8 May 2015 at the University of Copenhagen (Søndr
 e Campus\, Njalsgade 120\, DK-2300 København S\, Denmark). The conference
  is organised by the University of Copenhagen\, UiT - The Arctic Universit
 y of Norway\, and Kristianstad University. \n\nElfdalian is the most archa
 ic vernacular within Dalecarlian\, a group of dialects spoken in great par
 ts of Dalarna\, Sweden. In Elfdalian\, archaic features such as nasalised 
 vowels\, the syllable structure of Old Norse and conjugation of verbs with
  respect to number and person have been preserved. In contrast to these\, 
 Elfdalian also displays a number of innovations such as loss of h and diph
 thongisation of long i and u. Besides a number of a Nordic words that have
  been lost in standard Swedish\, Elfdalian contains several specifically D
 alecarlian or Elfdalian words\, and within syntax one may observe features
  such as omission of the subject with verbs of the first and second person
  plural. This combination of old and new is responsible for the unique app
 earance of Elfdalian and consequently for the unintelligibility of the lan
 guage for outsiders.\n\nIn modern times\, Elfdalian is spoken by up to 3\,
 000 people. Due to heavy pressure from standard Swedish\, mass media and a
  school system in which the use of Elfdalian was not allowed\, its status 
 as default means of communication in the former parish of Älvdalen (nowad
 ays part of the municipality of Älvdalen) has been severely impaired. Con
 sequently\, some of the ''classic'' features have disappeared. Elfdalian c
 omprises a regional variation between different parts of the former parish
  and nowadays also a variation between the generations. The linguistic dif
 ferences between the variants are\, however\, minor. A good deal of litera
 ture has been published in and on Elfdalian\, e.g. grammars and dictionari
 es. In 2005 for the first time ever\, a standard Elfdalian orthography was
  presented.\n\nThe society of Ulum Dalska (''We shall speak Elfdalian'') h
 as fought for the survival of Elfdalian for the last 30 years. Nowadays\, 
 the society lobbies to introduce Elfdalian in school and to have Elfdalian
  recognised as an official regional language of Sweden.

DESCRIPTION:Case and agreement are some of the most challenging topics for
  linguistic research\, and not in the least for acquisition theories. In L
 1 acquisition\, there has been a recent surge in research activities on ca
 se and agreement patterns. Eisenbeiß et al. (2012) provide a general over
 view of empirical studies and theoretical perspectives on L1 acquisition o
 f case. Bavin and Stoll (2014) present studies focusing on the acquisition
  of the ergative pattern by bilingual and monolingual children in a variet
 y of typologically diverse languages.\n\nIn comparison to the multitude of
  L1 studies\, little research has been done on the acquisition of alignmen
 t patterns in the field of Second Language Acquisition (SLA). To date\, on
 ly a few studies exist – at least to our knowledge. Montrul et al. (2012
 ) examined the acquisition (and possible loss) of morphosyntactic features
 \, such as case and agreement\, in heritage speakers of Hindi. Similar res
 earch has been done with foreign language learners by Baten and Verbeke (s
 ubm.) on Hindi and Charters (subm.) and Muagututi’a (2010) on Samoan. In
  addition\, single studies exist on Basque (Rodríguez-Ordóñez\, 2013)\,
  Finnish (Spoelman & Verspoor\, 2010)\, German (Baten\, 2013) and Russian 
 (Kempe & MacWhinney\, 1998). The aim of the workshop is to share and compa
 re the research findings of typologically divers languages. (References\,

 ne\, the University of Hong Kong\, Hong Kong\n\nFollowing on a decade from
  the 'Language & Global Communication' conference held at Cardiff Universi
 ty (2005)\, the sociolinguistics of globalization has emerged and develope
 d as an important\, interdisciplinary programme of research. Much excellen
 t work has broadened our understanding of the role of language in the repr
 esentation\, manifestation and spread of the ideologies and material proce
 sses of globalization. \n\nWe invite a reflection and re-assessment of the
 se issues. Specifically\, as suggested in the subtitle of the conference\,
  we propose to focus on issues of spatial and symbolic mobility\, change a
 nd paradigmatic state of flux that appear to characterize much of contempo
 rary social life. With the social\, cultural\, political and economic proc
 esses continuing to destabilize traditional 'centres' and normativities\, 
 we are interested in identifying new\, emerging regimes of language\, domi
 nant language ideologies\, and the resources that are deployed to maintain
  and to subvert these ideologies.\n\nWe continue asking two fundamental an
 d interrelated questions: How are we to continue theorizing language and c
 ommunication under globalization? How can sociolinguistic theory shed new 
 light on our understanding of globalization?\n\nPlenary Speakers:\n\n- Nik

DESCRIPTION:Derivational morphology is an underexplored area within the FD
 G model. Hengeveld and Mackenzie (2008) provide some suggestions for how t
 o account for derivational processes and a number of works have been devot
 ed to derivational issues (García Velasco\, 2009\, 2011\; Honselaar & Kei
 zer\, 2009\; Portero Muñoz\, 2011\; Genee 2013\; García Velasco & Keizer
  2014). However\, most of the attention has been paid to specific cases of
  word class-changing derivation\, synthetic compounding or conversion\, wh
 ile there are still many research topics within derivational morphology th
 at deserve further consideration in order to offer a comprehensive approac
 h to derivational processes\, as recently acknowledged (García Velasco & 
 Keizer 2014). Deeper thought also needs to be given to the question of wha
 t characterizes a functional approach to derivational morphology. The aim 
 of this workshop will thus be to contribute to the development of a unifie
 d and fully-fledged treatment of derivational morphology that is compatibl
 e with the explanatory principles of FDG.

DESCRIPTION:We belong to a culture characterised by a rich tradition of tr
 anslation and an equally lengthy history of marginalising translation as a
  discipline. The immeasurable influence which the translator’s work has 
 on dissemination and appropriation of knowledge\, has been broadened owing
  to contemporary translation theories – in their ever speedier and ever 
 more versatile development – to the realm of the culture as a whole\, (i
 n)ability of cultural dialogue and indigenous identity and to the use of m
 odern technologies. The global interest in translation theory is not the s
 ole motive for researching into the culture of translation and translating
  culture within the regional and within the world context. Thorn between t
 he controversial unification of the ”global language” and the measure 
 to which the language we speak is our own\, between everything that\, in a
  networking world could be had\, and everything that remains untranslatabl
 e within it\, between the policy of the literary\, linguistic and cultural
  fragmentation and ideology of the totality - issues of translating cultur
 es reach into all pores of the (not merely) contemporary world.

DESCRIPTION:MOMA 2015 MOdels for Modality Annotation\nmalvinanissim.github
 .io/moma2015 \nWorkshop co-located with IWCS 2015 - London\, 14 April 2015
 \nhttp://iwcs2015.github.io\n\nThe notion of modality involves a spectrum 
 of phenomena that are pervasive in language but far from being formalised.
  For an exhaustive formalisation\, a joint effort by computational\, corpu
 s\, and formal linguists as well as language typologists is required.\n\nC
 omputationally\, the automatic identification and interpretation of modali
 sed statements is a prime concern in a large number of applications\, espe
 cially with the recent attention to opinion mining and social networks. In
  corpus linguistics studies of modality-related phenomena\, researchers us
 e an incremental method based on redefining categories after assessing agr
 eement through several rounds of manual annotation\, with the aim of findi
 ng the right balance between feasibility and expressivity of categories. F
 ormally\, and from a comparative linguistics perspective\, characterisatio
 ns are sought of the range of modal types and their marking across the lan
 guages of the world\, towards a complete classification of modal functions
 .\n\nInsights from these traditions are crucial for the advancement of com
 putational work on modality\, since a comprehensive scheme for producing r
 eliable annotated data must obviously be usable from a computational persp
 ective\, but it also has to rely on a solid theoretical base. In other wor
 ds\, a balance must be found between accuracy and detailing in the descrip
 tion of the phenomenon\, and preventing proliferation of labels which migh
 t cause data to be too sparse to learn from\, and also lower agreement amo
 ng annotators.\n\nThe main aim of this workshop is to bring together resea
 rchers from all involved fields to join efforts in defining exhaustive and
  at the same time usable representations of modality\, towards working\, i
 mplementable annotation standards. **Beside the contribution of peer-revie
 wed research papers\, we envisage a truly hands-on event as part of this w
 orkshop\, where we would like to encourage participants to possibly try ea
 ch other's annotation tools and schemes\, and set up a roadmap for reachin
 g shared standards in the annotation of modality.**\n\nProgramme Committee

SUMMARY:Possession and Ownership in the “LENCA” Languages

DESCRIPTION:Possession and ownership in the “LENCA” languages\nA Works
 hop organized by Irina Nevskaya and Lars Johanson\n\nComplex system of own
 ership relations and the ways in which linguistic structures reflect cultu
 ral patterns\, attitudes to possession and effects of their change have at
 tracted the attention of Typological and Cognitive Linguistic relatively r
 ecently (Heine 1997\; Aikhenvald 2000\; Guéron 2007\; Aikhenvald and Dixo
 n 2013\; Nichols and Bickel 2013). Possessive constructions vary depending
  on the nature of the Possessor\, the Possessee and the Possessive relatio
 nship. They realize a set of recurrent core meanings: (i) ownership\, (ii)
  whole-part relations\, e.g. between a body or a plant and their parts\, (
 iii) kinship\, i.e. consanguineal and affinal relations\, etc.\n\nMany lan
 guages use essentially the same constructions for the core meanings. All c
 ombinations of the types are\, however\, found across the world’s langua
 ges. The degree to which possession is conceived as ‘the same’ differs
  from one society to another and is reflected in linguistic structures. \n
 \nPossession can be expressed with possessive noun phrases. Some languages
  have dedicated phrase types that cover the core meanings. Others represen
 t possessive meanings through more general associative noun phrases. A mar
 ker\, affixed or independent\, may be attached to the Possessor\, the Poss
 essee\, or both. Possessive constructions can vary along a further set of 
 parameters. \n\nPossessive relations can also be expressed beyond the noun
  phrase\, in clauses with predicative structures involving verbs of owners
 hip\, existential copula constructions\, locational constructions or verbl
 ess clauses. In a few languages\, possession can be expressed through verb
 al derivational affixes attached to the Possessor.\n\nA device going beyon
 d the clause is the Mandarin ‘double subject’ construction\, which ess
 entially involves topicalization of a Possessor. It consists of two juxtap
 osed noun phrases in clause-initial position\, both with subject-like role
 s. The first phrase refers to the ‘whole’\, the second one to its ‘p
 art’. Whole-part and close possession can also be expressed through rela
 tivization.\n\nThe choice of constructions may reflect different culturall
 y anchored types of ownership. \nThe proposed workshop will address these 
 and related problems\, especially in languages of Europe and Northern and 
 Central Asia (LENCA) that seem to be underrepresented in recent typologica
 l investigations.	\n\nLiterature:\n\nAikhenvald\, Alexandra Y. 2000. Class

DESCRIPTION:GLOW Workshop \nParis\, April 18\, 2015\n\nThe implications of
  computation and learnability for phonological theory\n\nOrganizers:\n\nGi
 orgio Magri\, Michela Russo\, \nMohamed Lahrouchi\, Joaquim Brandao de Car
 valho\n\nCrystallizing a widespread feeling\, Mark van Oostendorp recently
  writes: ''It is fair to say that we know much more about sound patterns i
 n human language than people did at the beginning of the 20th Century. At 
 the same time\, many phonologists seem to feel that we have not yet reache
 d the standards of some of the 'hard' sciences.'' A clear obstacle to prog
 ress seems to be the fact that competing phonological theories are underde
 termined by sheer typological and linguistic data. Moving beyond descripti
 ve adequacy\, Alan Prince thus proposes that ''rational arguments about tw
 o theories' comparative success […] depend on a broad assessment of thei
 r properties.'' Among the formal properties of a phonological theory which
  are becoming crucial for its comparative assessment are its computability
  and learnability properties. \n\nThis workshop thus aims at investigating
  the implications of computation and learnability for phonological theory.
  The issues addressed include (but are not limited to): the computability/
 intractability of phonological grammars and the debate among derivational\
 , representational\, and constraint-based frameworks\; learnability guaran
 tees and the debate between competing modes of constraint interaction\; th
 e characterization of phonological patterns within the sub-regular hierarc
 hy and the expressive power of phonological formalisms\; the learnability 
 filter and its implications for the evaluation of the typologies predicted
  by competing phonological theories\; methods for constraint induction and
  the problem of grounding phonology into phonetics\; the impact of statist
 ical methods and the divide between categorical and gradient models of pho
 nological competence\; the learnability of phonological processes conditio
 ned by prosodic domains and its implications for the syntax/phonology inte
 rface. The workshop adopts an inclusive perspective\, open to any computat
 ional approach and any phonological framework. \n\nInvited speakers: TBA

DESCRIPTION:Gender and Classifiers: Areal and Genealogical Perspectives\n\
 nFollowing our highly successful dissemination workshop ''Gender and class
 ifiers: Cross-linguistic perspectives'' on the typology of nominal classif
 ication systems in 2014\, this time we want to look more closely at the ar
 eal and genealogical distribution of gender and classifiers in the languag
 es of the world.\n\nCertain types of classification system are typically a
 ssociated with a language family or a linguistic area and we are intereste
 d in evidence which confirms or contradicts these tendencies.\nMany Indo-E
 uropean languages have a two-term or three-term gender system with a mascu
 line-feminine distinction\, where a subset of the nouns are allotted to th
 eir genders based on biological sex. In Africa the situation is different.
  While Afroasiatic languages (e.g. Arabic\, Somali\, Berber) have two-term
  gender systems build on a masculine-feminine contrast\, in Niger-Congo la
 nguages (e.g. Swahili\, Chichewa\, Eegimaa) larger systems are prevalent i
 ncluding a gender for either humans or animates.\n\nSoutheast Asian langua
 ges (e.g. Chinese\, Burmese\, Vietnamese) typically have numeral classifie
 rs\, which essentially specify counting units. The usual Australian gender
  system has four distinctions\, one of them being a gender for vegetables.
  If Australian languages have classifiers\, they tend to be noun classifie
 rs rather than numeral classifiers. Many languages in the Amazon area (e.g
 . Miraña\, Tucano\, Tariana) have been reported to have complex nominal c
 lassification systems mid-way between gender and classifiers.\n\nDate: 26-

DESCRIPTION:A topic of controversial debate today\, 'discourse & culture' 
 points to fundamental questions in contemporary society such as the role o
 f the mass media in the construction and transformation of reality\, the i
 nterrelationships between high and mass culture or the interpellations of 
 subjects in their communities. Discourse is seen as a set of enacted proce
 sses that establish\, protect or change conventions and thus reassemble th
 e wide area of both material and immaterial environment. Therefore\, the q
 uestion of how discourse affects culture through a long chain of mediated 
 actions and reactions stands in the focal point of many discourse research
 ers. The main aim of conference DN15 is to open an interdisciplinary dialo
 gue concerning discourse and culture.\n\nParticipants are furthermore invi

 the official part on Saturday if they want to become members\, propose new
  ideas or talk about collaborative perspectives for discourse research net
 work. Please send an email to the organizers if you want to join this meet

DESCRIPTION:Paris will host the next European Low Grade Glioma Network (EL
 GGN) meeting on 26-27 June 2015. A closed collaboration platform for resea
 rch on low grade glioma.\n \nIn June 2006 approximately fifty people gathe
 red for a two day informal conference in the Salpetriere Hospital in Paris
 \, discussing treatment options for low grade Glioma (LGG). Most of these 
 people had previously visited Paris because of the surgical management of 
 LGG patients by Hugues Duffau. Talks covered a broad range of topics rangi
 ng from functional neuroimaging and molecular biology to radiotherapy and 
 neurocognitive assessment. It became clear that there remain significant q
 uestions on all these terrains and that there is no single and simple trea
 tment strategy for LGG patients. New meetings were scheduled. \n\nThe main
  goal of the European Low Grade Glioma Network is to create a platform whe
 re clinicians and researchers can meet\, discuss treatment of LGG patients
  and share information and data for multicenter research. \n\nThere is a g
 rowing interest in applying current knowledge in linguistics and the neuro
 biology of language in targeting brain tumors before\, during\, and after 
 surgery. This network meeting is an excellent forum for (neuro- and psycho
 -)linguists\, (neuro-)psychologists\, speech and language therapists\, and
  surgeons interested in the language of patients with brain tumors\, langu
 age mapping\, among other issues related to the treatment of low grade gli
 omas (neuroradiology\, immunotherapy\, etc).\n\nTo register\, please send

DESCRIPTION:In recent years\, we have seen exciting advances in historical
  studies in the indigenous languages of South America: a series of confere
 nces on this topic in the last decade culminated in special issues of the 
 Boletím do Museu Emilio Goeldi (Galucio & Muysken 2007) and International
  Journal of American Linguistics (Galucio & Gildea 2010)\, and many of the
  presentations at the recent Amazonicas V conference in Belém\, Brazil\, 
 were on the topic of historical linguistics. However\, reconstruction of m
 orphosyntactic patterns depends on detailed modern descriptions\, which ha
 ve historically been lacking in South America\, and on solid methods\, whi
 ch have generally been more disputed than not. We believe that the quality
  and quantity of descriptive work in many languages of South America has r
 eached the critical mass necessary for historical work in grammatical patt
 erns\; the availability of this expanded database coincides with advances 
 in our ability to identify cognate constructions and reconstruct the sourc
 e constructions that give rise to them. \n\nThe goal of this workshop is t
 o give scholars a venue to explore the diachrony of any kind of morphosynt
 actic pattern in a language or language family of South America.

DESCRIPTION:Workshop to be held at ICHL 22\n\nThe workshop addresses chang
 es in the coding of spatial relations\, with a focus on the coding of simi
 larities and differences among spatial relations\, or among variants of th
 e same spatial relation\, in order to better understand the nature of asym
 metries in the encoding of spatial relations and shed light on the relatio
 nship between goals\, sources\, paths\, and static locations. Topics that 
 we would like to discuss include the source-goal asymmetry\, differential 
 marking of spatial relations\, polysemy or lack of polysemy among markers 
 of spatial relations\, and the related diachronic developments. \n\nConven

DESCRIPTION:The Faculty of Philology of the University of Belgrade is plea
 sed to announce the 15th International Conference on Minority Languages (I
 CML XV) which will be held in Belgrade\, Serbia\, May 28-30\, 2015.\n\nCon
 ference Theme:\n\nMinority languages in education and language learning: c
 hallenges and new perspectives\n\nInternational conferences on minority la
 nguages have been taking place on a regular basis since 1980. Their focus 
 has always been on the minority languages\, and with special emphasis on E
 uropean values of multilingualism and plurilingualism\, and in line with E
 uropean initiatives and documents regarding the maintenance\, status\, rev
 italization and place and role in educational systems of these languages. 
 \n\n“The series of International Conferences on Minority Languages offer
  an opportunity to discuss various disciplinary approaches. Good research 
 practices are transmitted and disseminated. Effective use of dialogue and 
 deliberation leads to an increase in policy formulation and basic research
 .” (Gorter\, 2009\, on-line document\, avaliable at:\n\nhttp://www.icml1
 3.org/fileadmin/icmlxiii/pdf/Minority_Languages_Today_brochure_2009.pdf \,
  p. 37)\n\nThe theme of the 15th ICML is the place and role of minority la
 nguages in formal and informal educational settings. It has been establish
 ed in academic literature and in democratic practices that the presence of
  minority languages (which serve as languages of primary socialization) in
  the educational systems brings very important benefits to children of tho
 se ethnolinguistic minority groups in terms of both cognitive and academic
  progress. This conference aims at fostering communication among theoretic
 ians and practitioners in minority language learning and teaching across E
 urope and aims at designing IT tools for promotion of minority language le
 arning and teaching in different socio-cultural contexts. \n\nThe primary 
 objective of the 15th ICML is to look at results achieved so far\, recogni
 ze examples of good practice and identify problems and challenges and prop
 ose new perspectives in the area of minority language education. The organ
 izers are hoping to bring together new theoretical approaches and practica
 l models of minority language education European and world-wide perspectiv
 e.\nA number of workshops promoting ethnolinguistic minorities living in S
 erbia which would help us all recognize and value ethnolinguistic diversit
 y in our country are planned for the duration of the 15th ICML in Belgrade
 \, in collaboration with different national and international cultural and
  academic institutions in the city.\n\nThe conference is organized\, but n
 ot restricted to the following topics within the above outlined general th
 eme:\n\n- Languages of early childhood education of ethnolinguistic minori
 ties: curriculum design and development \n- Languages of early childhood e
 ducation of ethnolinguistic minorities: legal perspectives\n- The role of 
 majority languages in education of ethnolinguistic minorities\n- ICT in ed
 ucation in minority languages\n- Primary and secondary bilingual education
  of children from ethnolinguistic minorities \n\nWhile ICML XV in Belgrade
  will continue the tradition of ICML to discuss these questions with respe
 ct to minority languages of Europe\, this conference also sets out to expa
 nd the scenery of ICML and therefore especially invites proposals concerni
 ng the study of minority languages in other parts of the world.

SUMMARY:Im/Politeness and Globalisation

DESCRIPTION:The ninth international im/politeness conference\, under the a
 egis of the Linguistic Politeness Research Group (LPRG) and the National a
 nd Kapodistrian University of Athens is to be held in Athens\, from 1-3 Ju
 ly 2015. The special theme of this three-day conference is Im/Politeness a
 nd Globalisation.\n\nResearch on im/politeness has witnessed an immense ex
 pansion over the last decades\, although issues of im/politeness have been
  of concern to people for centuries. On the other hand\, globalisation is 
 a term that has gained increasing momentum relatively recently. The concep
 t is complex and multi-faceted but broadly speaking it is assumed that it 
 will lead to homogenisation of every aspect of people’s lives. Discourse
  practices fall at the heart of globalisation not least because it entails
  mobility for various reasons and increasing numbers of various kinds of i
 nteractions both traditional and novel\, especially given the development 
 of technologically mediated means of communication. In this context\, lang
 uage itself is seen a commodity which sells well if it is wrapped up with 
 politeness (a hallmark of this being the service sector). A powerful kind 
 of politeness\, which despite its sounding alien to many\, is spreading\, 
 thus appears to be leading to the homogenisation of discourse practices. Y
 et this view is in sharp contrast with a basic tenet of much of the recent
  research on im/politeness\, namely that even within one culture there is 
 considerable variation as to what is perceived as polite or impolite. Howe
 ver\, since globalisation is a process which implies change\, this change 
 actually entails both homogenisation and diversification. Interestingly\, 
 globalisation has also been associated with an increase in impoliteness an
 d aggression\, especially in the media rather than seeing a growth in poli
 teness.

DESCRIPTION:Pre-conference workshop to be held at ICAME 36 (http://www.uni
 -trier.de/index.php?id=52257)\nTrier\, Germany\nWednesday 27 May 2015\n\nI
 n line with the current effort of corpus linguists to reduce the existing 
 paradigm gap between EFL (i.e.\, foreign English variants) and ESL (i.e.\,
  indigenized English varieties)\, this workshop focuses on the investigati
 on of linguistic innovations across the two non-native English variants. L
 inguistic innovations have been shown to characterize individual non-nativ
 e variants across several linguistic domains (e.g. phonology\, semantics\,
  morpho-syntax). Indian English\, for instance\, yields some of its most c
 reative forms and structures on the lexico-grammatical level in speakers' 
 innovative uses of prepositional verbs\, ditransitive verbs and light-verb
  constructions (Mukherjee & Hoffmann 2006\; Mukherjee 2010). While identif
 ying such kinds of innovations and distinguishing between errors and innov
 ations is essential to understand if and how New Varieties develop new con
 ventions (Van Rooy 2011)\, there is often an indeterminacy between what co
 unts as an innovation and what is regarded as an error (Bamgbose 1998). Pr
 evailing theoretical frameworks\, such as Kachru's (2006) Three Circles mo
 del\, have separated EFL and ESL as two distinct variants\, norm-dependent
  and norm-developing\, respectively. With this distinction\, however\, lin
 guistic deviations in EFL\, labeled as errors\, tend to coincide with thos
 e labeled as innovations in ESL (Edwards 2014).\n\nRecent (corpus) studies
  are beginning to challenge this dividing line between EFL and ESL and the
  general view that innovations and errors should be divided by institution
 al status alone (Bruthiaux 2003\, Deshors 2014\, Edwards 2014\, Gilquin 20
 11\, Laporte 2012\, Li & Mahboob 2012). By (i) recognizing shared innovati
 ons across the EFL and ESL variants and (ii) showing how English plays an 
 increasing role in identity construction and transcends its typical EFL fu
 nctions\, those studies present EFL users as creative speakers. They also 
 raise the question of the suitability of theoretical frameworks based on h
 istory and geographical legacy to accommodate discussions of language vari
 eties (Bruthiaux 2003\, Li & Mahboob 2012).

DESCRIPTION:The change in worship of polytheistic societies or the change 
 of faith in the monotheistic ones\, is a phenomenon studied by specialists
  of different historical\, archaeological\, anthropological or historical-
 religious disciplines\, but never seen in a multidisciplinary perspective 
 as a unitary phenomenon. For individuals a change of faith or voluntary sw
 itching to another religion is sometimes a strategy that accompanies the p
 rocess of integration as a result of migration\, and it is upon these proc
 esses\, in particular\, that we intend to dwell. The assumption of the fai
 th / confession / worship of the host society at the expense of the origin
 al one is a process that accompanies a change of identity\, with the persp
 ective of being welcomed in a new context and having the same opportunitie
 s. Religion or beliefs\, like the language\, the customs and habits of dai
 ly life\, becomes an element of a negotiation of personal identity.

 niversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. A special focus of this year’
 s ETAP is prosodic variability. Prosodic processing presents a challenge t
 o researchers because of the many sources of variability in how prosodic p
 henomena area realized. Prosodic information consists of bundles of featur
 es (e.g.\, pitch\, duration\, loudness\, intensity)\, but patterns of thes
 e features vary systematically across different speakers\, populations\, d
 ialects\, and contexts. They also vary randomly due to speech errors or no
 ise in the environment. A long-standing\, critical issue in the field is 
 understanding the nature of such variability in prosodic information as we
 ll as understanding how listeners maintain their prosodic representations 
 despite the variable input. This conference aims at bringing together res
 earchers from different disciplines who work on these issues\, as well as 
 researchers working on general questions in prosody research. We will pos

DESCRIPTION:''Big data and multimodality''\nPanel at the 14th Internationa
 l Pragmatics Conference\n\nConvenors: Cristóbal Pagán (University of Nav
 arra)\, Javier Valenzuela (University of Murcia)\, Inés Olza (University 
 of Navarra)\n\nPanel Abstract:\n\nThere is nowadays a wide consensus on th
 e need to provide linguistics with a solid empirical grounding. In this se
 nse\, the advent of electronic corpora has revolutionized linguistic pract
 ice\, and has quickly become a standard tool in the discipline. In the las
 t decades\, the size of available corpora has grown exponentially\, and as
  a result\, the field is now confronted with new challenges\, related to h
 ow to deal with extremely large amounts of (possibly annotated) textual ma
 terial. \n\nAt the same time\, most corpora are unimodal\, including only 
 the linguistic text of communication events. In this sense\, unimodal corp
 ora fall short of the complexity of real-life communication\, which is mul
 timodal: speakers construct meaning by combining linguistic material with 
 cues from other modalities\, such as prosodic information\, co-speech gest
 ures\, facial expressions\, eye-gaze\, or different aspects of the physica
 l context in which the communicative act takes place. The inclusion of the
 se multimodal aspects at a grand scale creates further challenges for corp
 ora research: from the need to rethink the right database architecture of 
 such corpora\, to the need for new multimodal annotation schemes\, new mul
 ti-layered search systems\, or new user-interfaces and query systems\, jus
 t to name a few. \n\nOne example of an initiative for developing a large-s
 cale multimodal corpus is the NewsScape Database of TV News\, curated by t
 he UCLA Library\, which currently contains more than 200.000 hours of TV p
 rograms with fully-searchable time-stamped subtitles. It is currently expl
 oited by the Red Hen Lab\, an international consortium for the research of
  multimodal communication. The present panel will introduce the NewsScape 
 library and some of the studies being developed by the Red Hen Lab. Additi
 onally\, the panel also welcomes contributions stemming from other multimo
 dal databases\, addressing issues such as the organization\, annotation an
 d information extraction of large-scale multimodal databases or presenting
  concrete studies based on these type of corpora. \n\nIt is our firm belie
 f that the big data approach is here to stay\, and that massive multimodal
  databases can bring linguistics nearer to other consolidated sciences tha
 t have at their disposal a great wealth of empirical observations\, such a
 s geology or astronomy.

DESCRIPTION:The Department of and Center for Middle Eastern Studies at the
  University of Texas at Austin are happy to announce the 5th Annual Jil Ja
 did ''New Generation'' Conference in Arabic\, Hebrew\, Persian\, and Turki
 sh Literature and Linguistics\, a graduate student conference to be held a
 t the University of Texas at Austin\, February 27-28\, 2015. For the past 
 four Februaries\, Jil Jadid has featured topics in Arabic literature and l
 inguistics. This year we are excited to expand its scope to include Hebrew
 \, Persian\, and Turkish literature and linguistics. \n\nJil Jadid is a gr
 aduate student conference that aims to provide a forum for young scholars 
 spread across a variety of disciplines to come together\, share ideas and 
 research\, and discuss the future of their respective fields. This is espe
 cially critical as they move forward in their careers and come to represen
 t the eponymous new generation of scholars engaging with the Middle East a
 nd its cultures. \nFor the past four Februaries\, graduate students from a
  wide range of universities\, both domestic and international\, have assem
 bled in Austin to set the tone for Arabic studies in the twenty-first cent
 ury. The ongoing positive feedback we have received from these past confer
 ences prompts us once again to assemble with the same goal. This year\, we
  are pleased to bring together our colleagues not only in Arabic studies\,
  but also in Hebrew\, Persian\, Turkish in order to facilitate a productiv
 e and interdisciplinary exchange of new ideas. \n \nFostering fruitful\, e
 ngaging\, and innovative dialogue remains our topmost priority. The confer
 ence will feature keynote speeches in linguistics and literature\, as well
  as a professional development panel offered by University of Texas facult
 y. In addition to individual presentations\, the conference will highlight
  explicit opportunities for participants to discuss their collective visio
 n for the development of their fields. More details will be announced as t
 he conference dates approach.\n \nThe 2015 Jil Jadid Conference is sponsor
 ed by the University of Texas at Austin's Department of Middle Eastern Stu
 dies\, Center for Middle Eastern Studies\, the Arabic Flagship Program\, D
 epartment of Linguistics\, Department of French and Italian\, Program in C

DESCRIPTION:Vor dem Hintergrund der zunehmenden Globalisierung\, der wachs
 enden Arbeitsmigration und der damit einhergehenden unterschiedlichen Spra
 ch- und Kulturkontakte kommt es im wirtschaftlichen Kontext zu neuen\, ins
 besondere sprachlichen Herausforderungen\, die bewältigt werden müssen. 
 Hierzu sollte auch die Romanistik einen wesentlichen Beitrag liefern\, den
 n in diesem Kontext könnte sie etwa der wachsenden Nachfrage nach fremdsp
 rachlich und interkulturell fachkundigen Spezialisten im Bereich der natio
 nalen und der internationalen Wirtschaftskommunikation entgegenkommen. Ein
 e angewandte Sprachwissenschaft mit einem Bezug zur Wirtschaft kann nicht 
 nur auf Probleme innerhalb wirtschaftlicher Diskurse oder etwa innerhalb i
 nterner und externer Unternehmenskommunikation eingehen und Lösungsansät
 ze schaffen\, sondern auch notwendige\, für die Romanistik zukunftsweisen
 de Kooperationen aufbauen und hierdurch einen wichtigen gesellschaftlichen
  Bezug herstellen.\n\nSeit Anfang des 20. Jahrhunderts entwickelt sich die
  Wirtschaftslinguistik als eine eigenständige Disziplin mit verschiedenen
  Strömungen heraus. So kommt es\, dass sich Linguisten vereinzelt mit spr
 achlichen Phäno-menen (u.a. im Bereich der Lexik\, Semantik\, Diskurstrad
 itionen) in Wirtschaftsdiskursen beschäftigen. Da Studien innerhalb der R
 omanistik vor allem auf einzelne Analysen und ausgewählte Bereiche ausger
 ichtet sind\, plädiert Winkelmann 2011 noch einmal für eine Wirtschaftsl
 inguistik aus romanistischer Perspektive. Heutzutage besteht jedoch nach w
 ie vor keine konsequente und breit gefächerte Zusammenarbeit zwischen der
  Wirtschaft und der romanistischen Linguistik. Einerseits scheinen die Ber
 ührungsängste noch groß\, andererseits scheint die Fülle an Möglichke
 iten linguistischer Analysen regelrecht zu einer Ohnmacht zu führen. Die 
 Breite der Thematik zeigt sich auf verschiedenen Ebenen: ob man grundsätz
 liche Herausforderungen und Fragen innerhalb der interkulturellen Unterneh
 menskommunikation behandelt oder einzelsprachliche Charakteristika in vers
 chiedenen wirtschaftlichen Diskursen untersucht\; z.B. die Analyse sprachl
 icher Strukturen in spanischen Börsenberichten oder die Betrachtung eines
  spezifischen Fachwortschatzes.\nIn der Sektion sollen daher Fallanalysen 
 vorgestellt werden\, die eine angewandte Sprachwissenschaft mit Bezug zur 
 Wirtschaft aufzeigen: Es sollen sowohl\n\n- Materialsprachliche Analysen i
 n verschiedenen Wirtschaftsdiskursen (u.a. sprachliche Strukturen in Börs
 enberichten\, Pressetexten von Unternehmen)\;\n- Studien zur betrieblichen
  Kommunikation innerhalb nationaler und internationaler Unternehmen\, aber
  auch bezogen auf ihre Außendarstellung in den romanischen Ländern (z.B.
  vergleichende Analysen zu ähnlich wirtschaftlich ausgerichteten Unterneh
 men wie Renfe in Spanien oder SNCF in Frankreich bzw. Studien eines Untern
 ehmens und dessen Darstellung wie etwa Ikea in Spanien\, Frankreich\, Port
 ugal) als auch\n- Untersuchungen zur interkulturellen Kommunikation unter 
 besonderer Berück-sichtigung nationaler Kulturen romanischer Länder (z.B
 . Analyse von Diskurstraditionen innerhalb eines in Deutschland\, Spanien 
 und Frankreich ansässigen Betriebs)\nBeachtung finden.

DESCRIPTION:Workshop: Formal Semantics Meets Cognitive Semantics\n\nJanuar
 y 22-23\, 2015\, Nijmegen\n\nSemantics is a divided discipline. On one sid
 e we have Formal Semantics\, which has its roots in logic and analytical p
 hilosophy (Frege\, Montague). Meaning here is viewed as a relation between
  language and external reality\, formalized in terms of reference\, truth\
 , possible worlds\, etc. On the other side we have Cognitive Semantics\, a
  central part of the Cognitive Linguistics movement\, which grew out of di
 ssatisfaction with formal linguistics (in particular\, formal semantics an
 d generative syntax) in the seventies (Fauconnier\, Lakoff\, Talmy). In th
 is framework meaning is primarily a relation between language and the mind
 \, described in terms of mental spaces\, conceptual schemata\, frames\, et
 c.\n\nToday\, the split between the two is as wide as ever. Both are evide
 ntly thriving disciplines\, but in almost complete isolation from each oth
 er. Given the apparent overlap in subject matter - natural language meanin
 g - this lack of interaction is surprising.\n\nIn this workshop we want to
  bring together researchers from both sides who contribute to bridging the
  gap in some way.\n\nInvited Speakers:\n\n- Arie Verhagen (Leiden)\n- Henk

DESCRIPTION:The research team of the ACiME (Academic Communication in Mult
 imedia Environment) project is pleased to announce the international confe
 rence “Academic Communication in Multimedia Environment”\, which will 
 be held in Sofia\, Bulgaria\, on 12-14 September 2015.\n\nThe conference c
 onstitutes the final stage in the completion of a three-year research proj
 ect (ACiME) financed by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation\, Germany\, 
 and realised by a team of scholars from Bulgaria and Germany. The hypothes
 is tested is that the Internet is a rich and unique non-linear multimedia 
 environment offering access to massive amounts of information\; It provide
 s new\, more effective ways of communicating ideas and an audience of unpa
 ralleled size and diversity. How does it\, however\, affect the production
 \, transmission and consumption of knowledge and what is the effect of glo
 balisation on academic communication?\n\nThe conference aims to bring toge
 ther researchers and practitioners in the field of academic communication 
 in the new media with a view to promoting interdisciplinary and intercultu
 ral dialogue and the elaboration of a suitable methodology for the elicita
 tion of the distinguishing features of academic communication in multimedi
 a settings and the new opportunities they offer for the realisation of int
 ertextuality and interdiscursivity. It is assumed that since multimedialit
 y would certainly allow for the establishment of a much wider range of int
 ertextual and interdiscursive links\, there should also be a threshold of 
 comprehension beyond which it would be very difficult\, if not impossible 
 for the audience in academia to perceive the links sought by the author (q
 uantitative aspects). Another facet of interest is to establish the degree
  of relevance of the hypertextual links to the academic needs and backgrou
 nd knowledge of the target audience (qualitative aspects).\n\nConfirmed Ke

DESCRIPTION:This conference\, organized in association with the AILA-ReN o
 n study abroad research\, brings together scholars and practitioners to ex
 plore the culture of study and residence abroad and their relationship to 
 foreign language learning.\n\nGiven the increasing mobility of students ac
 ross borders for the purpose of acquiring a foreign language in another cu
 lture and gaining cross-cultural experiences\, as well as the deepening ac
 ademic interest in language development and intercultural awareness in stu
 dy abroad\, this conference focuses specifically on the matter of culture 
 -- or cultures -- in foreign language study abroad contexts. Here\, 'cultu
 re' is understood within a range of meanings from the language\, customs\,
  institutions\, attitudes\, and behaviours of a social group\, to the prod
 ucts of human creativity such as literature\, music\, painting\, film\, an
 d pop culture\, to the appreciation and consumption of these forms either 
 in formal education or through personal inquiry.\n\nFocused on the Culture
  of Study Abroad\, as well as mindful of the conference location in Canada
  and its increased inward student mobility especially from Asia\, the conf
 erence organizers invite proposals for papers\, panels\, and workshops tha
 t concern one or more of the following questions: \n\n1. What is the cultu
 re of study abroad and its participants / stakeholders (teachers\, hosts\,
  etc.)? \n2. What is cultural learning on study abroad and its relationshi
 p to language acquisition? \n3. What is done with culture after studying a
 broad?\n4. What are the cultural implications of French exchanges in or fr
 om Canada?\n5. What are the cultural interests of language students moving
  from\, to\, and within Asia? \n\nThe first question focuses on community\
 , individual and group behaviour\, social networks\, identity\, and values
 \, but also home/foreign culture\, cultural translation\, and generational
 \, professional\, social-economic\, institutional\, and classroom cultures
  (students\, digital natives\, instructors\, host families\, the host publ
 ic\, etc.). It explores how such groups and contexts emerge\, function\, a

DESCRIPTION:This 7th edition of the NDLP conference series aims to respond
  to a surge of new research in pragmatics\, with a view to bringing togeth
 er the novel\, empirically\, experimentally and clinically based models\, 
 and classical topics/frameworks such as Gricean pragmatics\, Speech Act Th
 eory and presupposition. We encourage papers (re-)examining the semantics-
 pragmatics boundary\, which has been sometimes blurred by the confrontatio
 n of the new and the traditional frameworks. Proposals are welcome at the 
 intersection of the philosophy of language and pragmatics dealing with the
 oretical\, methodological and definitional issues\, as well as issues of i
 nterdisciplinarity in pragmatic investigation.\n \nWhile we specially enco
 urage presentations of theoretical approaches which have a basis in empiri
 cal studies\, or allow for experimentally testable predictions\, the confe
 rence continues to be open to all kinds of pragmatics oriented research re
 cognizing pragmatics as a functional (i.e. cognitive\, social and cultural
 ) perspective on language and communication. This applies to functional st
 udies involving multiple and heterogeneous territories: everyday discourse
 \, (online) media\, education\, political and professional settings\, prob
 lems of linguistic construction and maintenance of identity\, communicativ
 e genres\, issues of multilingualism and linguistic pluralism\, pragmatic 
 aspects of translation\, pragmatic awareness in foreign language teaching\
 , and more.\n\nKeynote Speakers:\n\nThe following distinguished scholars h

DESCRIPTION:To diversify the discussion of data explosion in the humanitie
 s\, the Research Unit for Variation\, Contacts and Change in English (VARI
 ENG) is organising an academic conference that addresses the use of new da
 ta sources\, historical and modern\, in English language research.\n\nBig 
 Data:\n\nIn recent years\, mega-corpora and other large text collections h
 ave become increasingly available to linguists. These databases open new o
 pportunities for linguistic research\, but they may be problematic in term
 s of representativeness and contextualisation\, and the sheer amount of da
 ta may also pose practical problems. We welcome papers drawing on big data
 \, including large corpora representing different genres and varieties (e.
 g. COCA\, GloWbE)\, databases (e.g. EEBO\, ECCO) and corpora created by we
 b crawling (e.g. EnTenTen\, UKWaC).\n \nRich Data:\n\nRich data contains m
 ore than just the texts\, including representations of spacing\, graphical
  elements\, choice of typeface\, prosody\, or gestures. This is further su
 pplemented by analytic and descriptive metadata linked to either entire te
 xts or individual textual elements. The benefit of rich data is that it ca
 n provide new kinds of evidence about pragmatic\, sociolinguistic and even
  syntactic aspects of linguistic events. Yet the creation and use of rich 
 data bring great challenges. We invite papers on the representation\, quer
 y\, analysis\, and visualisation of data consisting of more than linear te
 xt.\n\nUncharted Data:\n\nUncharted data comprises material which has not 
 yet been systematically mapped\, surveyed or investigated. We wish to draw
  attention to texts and language varieties which are marginally represente
 d in current corpora\, to data sources that exist on the internet or in ma
 nuscript form alone\, and material compiled for purposes other than lingui
 stic research. We welcome papers discussing the innovative research prospe
 cts offered by new and and previously unused or even unidentified material
  for the study of English in various contexts ranging from communities and
  networks to social groups and individuals.\n\nThe following invited speak

SUMMARY:SemEval 2015 Task 11: Sentiment Analysis of Figurative Language in

DESCRIPTION:TASK11@SEMEVAL-2015: Sentiment Analysis of Figurative Language
  in Twitter\n\nOne of the most difficult problems when assigning either po
 sitive or negative polarity in sentiment analysis tasks is to accurately d
 etermine what is the truth value of a certain statement. In the case of li
 teral language\, when there is not a secondary meaning\, existing techniqu
 es already achieve good results. However\, in case of figurative language 
 such as irony and affective metaphor\, when secondary or extended meanings
  are intentionally profiled\, the affective polarity of the literal meanin
 g may contrast sharply with the affect created by the figurative meaning. 
 Nowhere is this effect more pronounced than in ironic or sarcastic languag
 e\, which delights in using affirmative language to convey negative meanin
 gs. Metaphor\, irony and figurative language more generally demonstrate th
 e limits of conventional techniques for the sentiment analysis of literal 
 texts.\n\nSo figurative language creates a significant challenge for a sen
 timent analysis system\, as direct approaches based on words and their lex
 ical semantics are often shown to be inadequate in the face of indirect me
 anings. It would be convenient then if such language were rare and confine
 d to specific genres of text\, such as poetry and literature. Yet the real
 ity is that figurative language is pervasive in almost any genre of text\,
  and is especially commonplace on the texts of the Web and in social media
  communications. Figurative language often draws attention to itself as a 
 creative artifact\, but is just as likely to be viewed as part of the gene
 ral fabric of human communication. In any case\, Web users employ figures 
 of speech (both old and new) to project their personality through a text\,
  especially when limited to the 140 characters of a tweet.\n\nThis signifi
 cant challenge is the basis for SemEval Task 11\, for which trial and trai
 ning data are now available!\n\nThe Task:\n\nGiven a set of tweets that ar
 e rich in irony and metaphor\, the goal is to determine whether the user h
 as expressed a positive\, negative or neutral sentiment. A fine-grained se
 ntiment scale (scores in the range -5...+5) is be used to capture the effe
 ct of irony and metaphor on the perceived sentiment of a tweet. Participat
 ing systems will have to assign sentiment scores from the same fine-graine
 d scale to a set of given tweets.\n\nTrial (1000 figurative tweets) and tr
 aining data  (8000 figurative tweets): annotated and available at http://a

DESCRIPTION:Natural language understanding systems require a knowledge bas

 eings' cognitive system. Although surface semantics can be sufficient in s
 ome other systems\, the construction of a robust knowledge base guarantees
  its use in most natural language processing applications\, consolidating 
 thus the concept of resource reuse. This conference deals with meaning and
  knowledge representation in the context of natural language understanding
  from the perspective of theoretical linguistics\, computational linguisti
 cs\, cognitive science\, knowledge engineering or artificial intelligence.

 stics\, grammatical hypotheses are sign-based\, built around pairings of m
 orphological or positional signals with stable meanings. Explanation stems
  from the arbitrary communicative factor (the sign inventory) and the func

  opportunities for presenters to offer not only the conventional 20-minute
  paper\, but longer pieces when appropriate. The organizers see to it that
  each paper has ample time for in-depth questions and discussion. In addit

SUMMARY:Morphological Complexity: Empirical and Cross-linguistic Approache

UID:http://linguistlist.org/issues/25/25-3938.html
DESCRIPTION:Morphological complexity: empirical and cross-linguistic appro
 aches\n\nThe notion of “morphological complexity” (and “linguistic c
 omplexity” in general) has been on the linguistic agenda for more than a
  decade now (see\, e.g.\, McWhorter 2001\, 2005\; Dahl 2004\; Miestamo et 
 al. (eds.) 2008\; Sampson et al. (eds.) 2009\; Trudgill 2011). Thus far\, 
 there seems to be no consensus on several key issues\, such as whether mor
 phological complexity is a relative notion (“complexity for the learner
 ”) or rather an “absolute” phenomenon\; how morphological complexity
  can be measured and compared across languages\; and\, crucially\, what ph
 enomena constitute morphological complexity.\nIn current typological work\
 , measures of morphological complexity are all based on the notion of morp
 heme and ultimately involve counting morphemes in one way or another (cf.\
 , e.g.\, “complexity” as sum of head- and dependent-marking points in 
 Nichols 1992 or “category-per-word” value in Bickel & Nichols 2013). H
 owever\, linguists approaching morphological complexity from the perspecti
 ve of diachrony or language contact (e.g.\, Dahl 2004 or Trudgill 2011) ha
 ve suggested that an important\, if not the primary\, locus of morphologic
 al complexity is “autonomous morphology” (cf. Cruschina et al. 2013)\,
  i.e. morphological entities and processes which are not straightforwardly
  extramorphologically motivated\, such as inflectional classes\, allomorph
 y\, patterns of syncretism\, and the like. As is well known\, such phenome
 na can be diachronically stable (Dahl 2004\; Maiden 2005) but\, at the sam
 e time\, are the first candidates for loss in situations of language shift
  or creolization (McWhorter 2001\; Trudgill 2011).\n\nThe goal of our work
 shop is to bring together linguists working on morphological typology\, au
 tonomous morphology\, and language contact\, in order to study the followi
 ng fundamental\, though yet unsolved\, issues:\n\n1) What exactly constitu
 tes morphological complexity?\n2) Do the following morphological phenomena
  contribute to morphological complexity and how can they be assessed from 
 such perspective?\na. Affixes: affix ordering (e.g. templatic morphology)\
 , syntagmatic interactions between morphological markers (e.g.\, between p
 refixes and suffixes\, or between suffixes of different orders) in terms o
 f restrictions on co-occurrence\, allomorphy\, and semantic interpretation
 \nb. Morphophonology\, i.e. sandhi\, ablaut\, lenition\, etc.\nc. Stems: s
 tem allomorphy\, stem suppletion\,  morphomic distributions\, etc.\nd. Par
 adigm structure: e.g.\, syncretism\, deponency\, extended exponence\, prin
 cipal parts etc.\ne. Autonomous morphology: inflectional classes\, heteroc
 lisis\, morphomes of different kinds (Aronoff 1994)\, etc.\nf. Non-concate
 native and non-linear morphology\ng. Interactions between bound morphology
  and periphrasis\n3) How can morphological complexity be measured in an ad
 equate way\, i.e. taking into account the phenomena listed above (see\, e.
 g.\, Bonami 2012\; Bonami et al. 2011)?\n4) How can morphological complexi
 ty be compared across languages in a principled and unbiased way\, in ligh
 t of the plethora of empirical phenomena subsumed under “morphology”\,
  though not being limited to morpheme or category counts?\n5) Which phenom
 ena pertaining to morphological complexity\, and under which circumstances
 \, are prone resp. resistant to loss in different situations of language c
 ontact?\n6) Are there morphological phenomena that\, in situations of lang
 uage contact\, are subject to an increase in complexity?

 workshop is the fourth in a series of successful meetings that took place 
 in Stockholm (January 2009)\, Iowa City (June 2010) and Vitoria-Gasteiz (M

 d in multilingual acquisition\, processing and language use of a third (L3
 ) language and whose work is carried out within a formalized theory of lan
 guage and whose approach is based in some application of cognitive science
 . The main motivation behind research done within cognitive approaches to 
 L3 acquisition so far has been to find explanations for the complex cognit
 ive nature of the multilingual mind\, that is\, how issues that have been 
 dealt with in bilingualism would fare when one individual juggles three or
  more linguistic systems. We welcome work exploring acquisition and the ro

 ge acquisition\, in impact on development and ultimate attainment\; work o
 n the role of input (quality and quantity)\, linguistic and cognitive inte
 rnal as well as other external variables\; work on child and adult multili

DESCRIPTION:Tenth Creolistics Workshop: “Innovations”\n- with special 
 attention to parallels between creole and sign language creation\n\nAarhus
  University\, Denmark\, 8-10 April 2015\nhttp://www.creolisticsX.dk\n\nThe
  Creolistics Workshop\, which has previously been held in London (UK)\, Am
 sterdam (NL)\, Giessen (D) and Aarhus (DK)\, has a long tradition for bein
 g a forum of exchange and inspiration in the creolistics community. For th
 e tenth edition\, the main focus will be on innovations\, primarily in cre
 oles and sign languages\, but also in other types of languages where conta
 ct has played an important role.\n\nCreole studies have traditionally focu
 sed on continuation and universals\, discussing for instance the contribut
 ions of the lexifiers and substrates. In past decades\, an important body 
 of literature in creolistics has been produced with the goal of weighing t
 he influences from the various contributing languages to creole formation.
  However\, much less attention has been given to innovations\, in particul
 ar lexical\, semantic\, syntactic and typological aspects that cannot easi
 ly be attributed to the known input languages.\n\nTherefore\, the aim of t
 his workshop will be to shift the focus from a historical approach to creo
 les to a more cognitively-oriented framework whose primary goal will be to
  explain why certain strategies and structures are innovated and selected 
 in the creation of new language varieties\, while others are not.\n\nAs si
 gn languages have been argued to show social and structural commonalities 
 with creoles\, special attention is given to Deaf Sign Languages.

DESCRIPTION:Discourse Markers and Experimental Pragmatics\nÓscar Loureda\
 , Adriana Cruz\, Inés Recio (Research Group DPKog)\n\nFrom a cognitive ap
 proach to discourse\, utterance interpretation is widely assumed to be per
 formed by means of inferential computations. As a result\, it is expectabl
 e for languages to have specific devices at their disposal that minimize t
 he addressee’s cognitive effort in her aim to process the meaning of wha
 t is uttered. \n\nDue to their fundamentally procedural meaning (cf. Blake
 more 1987\, 2002\; Blass 1990\; Wilson & Sperber 1993\, Fraser 1999 among 
 many others)\, discourse markers constrain the inferential processes in co
 mmunication guiding the hearer or reader to the expectable cognitive effec
 ts and contributing to minimize her processing effort. As a result\, as in
 tentional communication devices\, it seems plausible that discourse marker
 s could constitute an attentional focus in discourse comprehension and pro
 duction.\n\nCompared to the abundance of descriptive studies based on obse
 rvation\, experimental studies on discourse markers are still rather scarc
 e. However\, evidence from experiments of a psychological nature can give 
 a good account of the reactions (processing efforts) to given stimuli (utt
 erances)\, what at the same time could help confirming or discarding hypot
 hesis obtained by other approaches to pragmatic research (Noveck & Sperber
  2004). Therefore\, the aim of our panel is precisely to create a forum fo
 r scientific discussion in which complementary experimental approaches to 
 the study of discourse markers can be presented.

 5) is to revisit European language diversity - which is in the process of 
 radical transformation -with a completely unique\, bottom-up approach: by 
 profoundly engaging the affected communities themselves in this process\, 
 in order that policies and decisions can be made in response to the real a
 nd actual needs of these communities.\n\nThe Research Centre for Multiling
 ualism (RCM) of the Research Institute for Linguistics of the Hungarian Ac
 ademy of Sciences\, alongside four other international partners\, plays a 
 major role in the above-mentioned project: thanks to its presence\, the so
 cial issues specific to the Central-Eastern European region – particular
 ly\, discourses affecting highly disadvantaged groups\, such as the Roma a
 nd the Deaf community come to the focus of the widest possible audience of
  experts and policy-makers. Also exemplary initiatives will be in the lime
 light\, which turn our region and our country into a role model for other 
 states. Both in its content and its methodological approaches\, the confer
 ence aims to create a multidisciplinary platform for researchers\, policy-
 makers\, educators as well as media practitioners and experts which deals 
 with the issues concerning the present and the future of minority communit
 ies and their languages in a framework with efficient permeability between
  the above-mentioned disciplines and from a completely new perspective: th
 e representatives of the individual disciplines come to think together wit
 h the affected communities by being “tuned” to their position\, intere
 sts and knowledge\, in mutual engagement while learning with and from each
  other. Hence\, the two-day conference provides an excellent opportunity f
 or researchers\, politicians\, practitioners and the members of minority c
 ommunities from Hungary\, Central-Eastern Europe and the EU to meet and en
 ter into a dialogue while focussing on the legal\, language policy and med
 ia aspects of linguistic diversity along the lines of education\, learning
  and access to knowledge in the broadest possible sense. By all this\, the
  event aims to convey the message that the linguistic diversity of Europe 
 can only then be sustained long term\, if new perspectives and forms of kn
 owledge and competence exchange are involved\, and if in addition to polit
 ical\, legal\, academic and educational experts\, also the new roles of th
 e affected communities as well the best practices of grassroot movements a
 re drawn into it.\n\nBesides the plenary and section presentations\, round
 table discussions\, workshops and other interactive programmes\, the event
  will also host numerous video demonstrations\, internet platforms\, prese
 ntations of community engagement practice and a poster exhibition.\n\nFor

DESCRIPTION:Panel Coordinators:\n\nMiguel Casas Gómez (University of Cadi

 \n\nIn recent decades\, the field of lexical semantics has seen a shift fr
 om structural (language-immanent) analyses to a more cognitive approach th
 at focuses on the interplay between the extralinguistic world and its ment
 al and linguistic mapping. The field has also changed from a rather synchr
 onic theoretical framework to a diachronic and variationist perspective th
 at demands still further theoretical understanding. Furthermore\, anti-sem
 antic theories of syntax and even morphology have been abandoned in favor 
 of a semantic understanding of functional units (the processes of grammati
 calization\; mood not only marked by\, but expressed through meaningful mo
 rphemes\, etc.). Lexical semantics\, as it turns out\, is a field rather o
 pen to research of both lexicon and grammar. Moreover\, disciplines such a
 s terminology have tried to integrate semantic theory. Defying linguistic 
 theory\, the conflicts between semantic and pragmatic approaches still dom
 inate the field. Traditionally\, lexical semantics\, and semantics in gene
 ral\, have played only a minor role in Hispanic linguistics. We intend thi
 s panel to serve as a platform for discussions on the current state of the
  research and new perspectives with regard to Spanish linguistic studies.\

DESCRIPTION:University of Sfax\, Tunisia\nFaculty of Arts and Humanities\n
 The English Department and the Laboratory on Approaches to Discourse (LAD)
  jointly organise on 2-4 April 2015 an international conference \non: Poli
 tics and Poetics of Belonging.\n\nIn “Answering the Question: What is Po
 stmodernism?”\, Jean-François Lyotard argues that “[e]clecticism is t
 he degree zero of contemporary \ngeneral culture: one listens to reggae\, 
 watches a western\, eats McDonald’s food for lunch and local cuisine for
  dinner\, wears Paris perfume in \nTokyo and ‘retro’ clothes in Hong K
 ong.” In this sense\, each of us would adopt a number of cultural identi
 ties that cater for the dominant \ncosmopolitanism and weaken one’s nati
 onal anchorage. As all people and nations experience a state of flux\, nat
 ional culture loses its solidity \nin the context of major world transform
 ations where international social\, political\, and cultural institutions 
 attempt to construct and defend a \nglobal unified culture to which we are
  called\, or rather forced\, to belong.\n\nThis conference will set to exp
 lore how the concept of belonging has been defined\, encoded\, acted out\,
  and de/constructed through literary \nand cultural texts\, the visual art
 s\, and the media across time and space. In fact\, the search for belongin
 g spatially\, linguistically\, intellectually\, \npolitically\, ideologica
 lly\, aesthetically\, or emotionally produces discourses and narratives of
  one sort or another that help us understand the \nway we are included or 
 excluded\, accepted or rejected\, represented or misrepresented. The objec
 tive of this conference is to bring together \npapers that attend to the w
 ays belonging is imagined\, constructed\, and articulated as an unavoidabl
 e need.

DESCRIPTION:The aim of this workshop is to approach the functioning of aff
 irmative strategies in oral \ninteraction from a monolingual or contrastiv
 e perspective.\n\nWhile argumentative discourse and\, within it\, disagree
 ment and contradiction strategies\, have \nbeen the subject of several stu
 dies since the 1980s  (Gelas & Kerbrat-Orecchioni 1980: Le \ndiscours pol
 émique)\, affirmation strategies remain a vastly unexplored field of stud
 y\, perhaps \ndue to their neutral and unmarked functioning in the convers
 ation. An initial issue concerns \nthe very definition of “affirmation
 ”. We have purposely chosen a vague terminology and \naccepted a wide in
 terpretation of the term\, namely: signaling affirmation or agreement in \
 nlanguages is positively assessing the interlocutor's assertion/question o
 r positively assessing \na binary exchange (- You leave at eight – Yes/O
 k/ All right). In this sense\, examining \naffirmation strategies in langu
 ages implies focusing on discourse markers such as Ok\, All \nright\, Sure
  and all those belonging to this microsystem in English\, or Vale\, Sí\, 
 De acuerdo / \nVoilà\, Oui\, D’accord\, etc. in Spanish and French\, fr
 om different points of view (phonetic\, \nprosodic\, semantic\, syntactic 
 and pragmatic). It also includes studying phenomena related to \nthe appro
 priation of the floor by the interlocutor and co-enunciation. Lastly\, it 
 requires \ndigging deeper into the construction of consensus during intera
 ction in languages. The fact \nthat affirmation markers are not always tra
 nslatable from one language to another may stem \nfrom the way in which co
 nsensual interaction is built\, as the conception of a successful \nexchan
 ge can vary substantially from one linguistic culture to another.\n\nThe w
 orkshop aims to create the opportunity for exchange around affirmation str
 ategies in \nvarious languages between researchers from different fields o
 f study. Two meetings will be \norganized:\n\n- The first will take place 
 at the University of Salerno\, April 2-3\, 2015.\n- The second at the Univ
 ersité Paris Ouest Nanterre La Défense\, October 2015.

SUMMARY:Pragmatics and Classical Languages
DTSTART;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20150902T000000

UID:http://linguistlist.org/issues/25/25-4041.html
DESCRIPTION:The pragmatic point of view is increasingly taken into account
  in Classical studies. Latin and Greek share some characteristics with oth
 er ancient languages\, especially the lack of native speakers preventing u
 s from checking the results in a direct way. On the other hand\, they cann
 ot be said to be part of the growing movement of historical pragmatics. Th
 e corpora of Classical texts are specific in several respects: (a) Latin a
 nd Greek provide us with substantial texts encompassing various text types
  coming from various periods\; (b) the Classical texts are mainly highly s
 tylised literary texts\, which implies considerations about stylistics (rh
 ythmical or metrical prose\, metrics in poetry). Such characteristics requ
 ire a special methodology.\n\nThis workshop aims at stimulating the discus
 sion of more general pragmatic issues concerning Classical languages in or
 der to share the results of various investigations and draw conclusions of
  a more general concern. It has two goals: to address issues specific to t
 hese languages and to provide new insights in pragmatic phenomena encounte
 red. Additionally\, this workshop will focus on a comparison of the result
 s obtained for Latin and Greek and on methodological problems connected wi
 th pragmatics in these languages.\n\nIssues to Address:\n\n(i) Specificity
  of the corpora\n\nPragmatically oriented studies of Classical languages f
 ace similar difficulties as other ancient languages. How do we guarantee t
 hat our interpretations are valid? Which factors can be determined as reli
 able in order to compensate the lack of native speakers and\, consequently
 \, the lack of information about intonation? The influence of transmission
  of the texts and the low reliability of punctuation (as an outcome of mor
 e recent interpretation(s) of the texts) can represent additional complica
 tions.\n\n(ii) Linguistic parameters\n\n– Context\nThe role played by th
 e context\, both immediately preceding and more distant\, is crucial for d
 etermining the information structure of a sentence. A systematic treatment
  of this question is necessary.\n– Discourse structure\nParticles and ot
 her discourse indicators are essential for a description of the discourse 
 structure. This topic is far from being an exhausted subject.\n– Genres 
 and text types\nClassical texts are (mostly) highly stylised literary text
 s. The question is how stylistic factors correlate with pragmatic ones. Fo
 r example in prose\, it is important to determine the relationship between
  metrical or rhythmical clausulae and the pragmatic saliency of constituen
 ts. In poetry\, information structure is supposed to be based on the same 
 principle as that in prose\; however\, stylistics can involve additional v
 ariation.\nStudies about non-literary texts (technical texts or inscriptio
 ns) are welcome.\n\n(iii) Extra-linguistic parameters\n\n– Shared knowle
 dge\nShared knowledge is an important factor that determines the choice of
  linguistic means and/or the placement of constituents. This domain needs 
 to be explored in a detailed way.\n– Social context\nThe respective posi
 tion of the speaker and the addressee (relationships of power and/or intim
 acy\, for example) is another parameter which plays an important role in t
 he linguistic form chosen during the interaction.\n– Sensibility to cult
 ural context\nIn a culturally distant context\, the evaluation of cultural
  norms\, which can vary according the sub-groups under discussion\, is a d
 ifficult but necessary issue\, when facing topics such as politeness.

 d a Geo-critical Study of Language\, Literature\, Culture and Politics\nIn
  Memory of Stuart Hall\n8- 10 April 2015\n\nThe dialectics of time and spa
 ce is inherent in the distinction between the notions of space and place. 
 Literally\, space denotes “a continuous area which is unoccupied as well
  as the dimensions of height\, depth and width within which all things exi
 st and move.” Space might also refer to an interval of time. Place\, how
 ever\, refers to a particular position or point in space\, a location (OED
 ). “Place is a calm centre of established values” (Tuan 54). Conversel
 y\, space is “actuated by the ensemble of movements deployed within it\,
 ” as it “occurs as the effect produced by the operations that orient i
 t\, situate it\, temporalize it. In short\, space is a practiced place” 
 (de Certeau 117). \n\nRather than being predefined by external forces\, sp
 ace synchronically bears its own social\, historical\, political and even 
 textual and intertextual practices\, which in turn destabilise and deterri
 torialise the “established values” that confine it within the realm of
  a particular place. Signalling the “spatial turn” of the century\, th
 e geocritical notion of space\, along with such related concepts as mappin
 g\, border\, spatiality\, routes\, contact zones\, deterritorialisation an
 d reterritorialisation\, have provided new and fresh avenues for literary 
 criticism and cultural studies. Spatial practices\, spatial semantics\, or
  geocriticism\, indeed reveal that “all writing partakes in a form of ca
 rtography\, since even the most realistic map does not truly depict the sp
 ace\, but\, like literature\, figures it forth in a complex skein of imagi
 nary relations” (Tally 134).

SUMMARY:Clitics: Areal and Genealogical Perspectives

DESCRIPTION:The phenomenon of clitics has generated a vast body of literat
 ure\, from several theoretical perspectives. Yet defining what a clitic ha
 s been compared to “trying to catch minnows with your bare hands” (Spe
 ncer & Luís 2012: xiii). Clitics are so hard to define mainly because the
 ir behavior is determined by the interaction of several parameters that ar
 e independent from each other at least to a certain extent\, and that more
 over interact with different areas of grammar (phonology\, morphology\, sy
 ntax).\n\nIn this workshop we propose to regard clitics from the perspecti
 ve of language change. Clitics can be thought of as a stage in a grammatic
 alization process\, in which elements gradually become more affix-like (or
 \, more controversially\, the reverse). Given the many independent paramet
 ers and the areas of language structure involved in how clitics behave\, t
 here are many potential pathways of change\, and many different orders in 
 which elements may change their behavioral properties. In addition\, other
  diachronic processes have been addressed less often in the comparative li
 terature\, from stabilization of clitics to their erosion and loss. The id
 ea behind the workshop is that taking a diachronic perspective can give us
  new insights into the phenomenon of clitics\, different conceivable subty
 pes\, their diachronic stability\, and to what extent possible diachronic 
 paths are areally and/or genealogically determined. The questions we would
  like to address include the following:\n\n- Are (subsets of) clitics diac
 hronically stable?\nIs there much variation in the clitic inventories betw
 een related languages in terms of function\, phonology\, syntax\, or morph
 ology\, or are they rather comparable and stable? If there is variation\, 
 what is the main locus thereof (pragmatics\, semantics\, syntax\, phonolog
 y\, morphology)? \n\n- Are (subsets of) clitics contact-sensitive?\nSyntac
 tic units are generally seen as more likely to undergo contact-induced cha
 nge than morphological units. Do clitics fall in between these two poles\,
  or are they actually more contact-sensitive because they are diachronical
 ly unstable and therefore more prone to change through contact?  \n\n- Are
  there preferred grammaticalization paths?\nDoes the comparison of clitic 
 systems of related languages suggest a particular diachronic path within t
 hat family that is consistent with what we know about the evolution of tha
 t language family? Are there preferred orders of change?\n\n- How sensitiv
 e are different definitions of clitics to descriptive traditions?\nOne of 
 the recalcitrant problems with clitics is that there seems to be no consen
 sus on what we should and what we should not consider as clitics. One of t
 he factors that may contribute to this problem is that different descripti
 ve traditions for a certain language family or macro-area regard clitichoo
 d and cliticization in different ways.\n\nSpencer\, Andrew & Ana R. Luís

DESCRIPTION:Workshop: Shared Processing in Language and Music - What Neuro
 cognition and Disorders Reveal (SPLM)\n\nThe workshop is embedded in the S
 MART Cognitive Sciences Conference that is held from March 25-28\, 2015.\n
 \nDescription:\n\nTraditionally\, language and music have been regarded as
  two separate domains. Growing evidence\, however\, suggest that these two
  domains share at least certain processes. While there is more interesting
  research every day\, part of what makes this field so exciting is that th
 ere are still two very different perspectives: Those who emphasize the dif
 ferences between music and language and those who emphasize the similariti
 es. Not only behavioral paradigms but more and more neurophysiological tec
 hniques are used to test hypotheses arising from those different perspecti
 ves and to investigate the neural underpinnings of possibly shared cogniti
 ve processes. At the same time\, disorders that affect either faculty but 
 supposedly spare the other\, such as amusia and aphasia\, are of great int
 erest\, too\, as they can also lead to insights on what is shared by both 
 domains and what is not.\n\nThis workshop aims at bringing together scient
 ists from as diverse fields as linguistics\, musicology\, psychology\, neu
 rology and biology in order to foster an interdisciplinary dialogue that m
 ight create a better understanding of the shared processes in music and la
 nguage.\n\nKeynote Speakers:\n\nProf. Dr. Usha Goshwami\, University of Ca

DESCRIPTION:The Bridging Language Acquisition and Language Policy symposiu
 m explores intersections between two research fields: language policy and 
 language acquisition\, which together inform language acquisition planning
 . The aim of the symposium is to facilitate dialogue about what researcher
 s in the two fields should know about core issues and findings in each oth
 er’s areas in order to strengthen and inform endeavors around language a
 cquisition planning. There is a salient need for such dialog because resea
 rchers in these two fields together have the potential to influence how po
 liticians and educators create policies that affect how children and adult
 s learn languages for academic\, economic\, and other purposes. \n\nThe un
 derlying premise of the symposium\, then\, is that language acquisition pl
 anning work can be enhanced by sociologists of language and language acqui
 sition researchers mutually raising awareness about the cognitive\, socioc
 ultural\, and political contexts in which (mother tongue\, foreign\, and s
 econd) language use\, acquisition\, and teaching take place. By engaging w
 ith research work across the two fields\, researchers can strengthen their
  abilities to inform policy stakeholders such as legislators\, curriculum 
 planners\, educational administrators\, teachers\, parents\, and other com
 munity members.\n\nKeynote Speakers:\n\nDiane Larsen-Freeman – Universit

DESCRIPTION:Contradictorily the concept of intercultural competence is bot
 h polysemic and empty at the same time. Researchers\, practitioners but al
 so decision makers use it almost mechanically without always worrying abou
 t its meaning(s)\, the ideologies it represents\, the impact(s) it has on 
 those who are embedded in its discussions and the injustice it can (too ea
 sily) lead to such as neo-racism. A few ‘usual suspects’ – mostly de
 rived from English-speaking researchers/practitioners who enjoy prestige t
 hanks to the symbolic violence of English as a World Language and/or prest
 igious supranational support – whose work is systematically (and uncriti
 cally) mentioned have often managed volens nolens to keep mainstream globa
 l understandings of intercultural competence simplified\, fuzzy\, idealist
 ic and/or unrealistic. For example the ‘faulty’ keywords of culture\, 
 tolerance and respect are still present in discussions of intercultural co
 mpetence.

DESCRIPTION:Non-canonical gender systems\n\nGender is famously ''the most 
 puzzling of the grammatical categories'' (Corbett 1991: 1)\, yet gender sy
 stems across the world's languages share a number of characteristics.  Som
 e of these are definitional. For example\, since gender is defined as a mo
 rphosyntactic feature\, the presence of agreement is a necessary condition
  – the gender of a noun must be marked on at least one element other tha
 n the noun itself.\n\nOther properties\, by contrast\, are expected rather
  than required. Canonically\, a gender system conforms to the following ex
 pectations:\n\n- Any noun belongs to at least one gender\n- Each noun only
  belongs to exactly one gender\n- The number of genders in a language is s
 mall and finite\n- The gender system has a semantic core\, typically based
  on the conceptual features sex\,\nhumanness or animacy\n- Gender is marke
 d on more than one lexical category\n- Gender is marked in more than one s
 yntactic domain\n- Markers that express gender are morphologically bound\n
 - Given the same noun\, all gender markers are consistent across target ca
 tegories and utterances.\n\nFor this workshop\, we are looking for gender 
 systems that are non-canonical in that they violate one or more of these e
 xpectations. This could\, for example\, include systems with unusually num
 erous or highly variable genders\, or with exceptionally sparse agreement 
 systems. In particular\, we are looking for languages in which gender appe
 ars to shade into other feature systems\, like number or classifier system
 s\, or strategies of diminuation and augmentation. Examples are the system
  of Miraña (Seifart 2005)\, which is intermediate between a gender and a 
 classifier system and the diminutive/gender markers in Walman (Brown & Dry
 er 2008). Abstracts addressing such phenomena are particularly welcome.\n\
 nKeynote speaker will be Professor Greville G. Corbett (University of Surr
 ey).

 cation and expression in a variety of contexts and with a range of effects
 . Modelling figurative patterns of communication/expression is a key aim o
 f academic disciplines such as linguistics\, philosophy\, discourse studie
 s\, and psycholinguistics\, and automatically understanding such phenomena
  is a long-standing and now expanding endeavour within Artificial Intellig
 ence. A particularly interesting current area of research is work on autom
 atically generating as well as understanding metaphor – both understandi
 ng and generation are emerging as important sites for addressing long-stan
 ding problems in linguistics\, artificial intelligence\, philosophy\, and 
 cognitive science more generally. In addition\, some researchers have sugg
 ested that metaphor can be an intrinsic part of thought\, not just of exte
 rnal communication/expression.

 ages of the Americas Organized by Helder Perri Ferreira and Joshua Birchal
 l\n\nDate: July 12-15\, 2015\nLocation: San Salvador\, El Salvador\n\nThe 
 indigenous languages of the Americas show incredibly diversity in the gram
 matical strategies that they use to express the participants of an utteran
 ce. Over the last century\, it has been noted that certain language treat 
 grammatical arguments differently based on their predicate class. As the q
 uantity and quality of the descriptive materials for these languages has i
 ncreased\, factors beyond predicate class\, such as tense-mood-aspect\, po
 larity and referentiality\, have increasingly been described as producing 
 multiple patterns (i.e.\, splits) in the ways that languages express their
  arguments. While our descriptive terminology has progressed considerably 
 thanks to a renewed interest in language description and large-scale typol
 ogy\, what is still lacking in the field is a detailed understanding of th
 e diachronic processes that lead to the formation of these complex pattern
 s.

DESCRIPTION:The Institute of English at the University of Silesia is pleas
 ed to invite you to the 27th International Conference on Foreign and Secon
 d Language Acquisition (ICSFLA). Following our tradition\, the conference 
 will focus on a specific theme in researching second language acquisition 
 and foreign language learning. The leading theme of the 27th ICSFLA is:\n\
 nPositive psychology in second/foreign language acquisition and learning\n
 \nThe chosen theme of the 27th conference is fairly new as positive psycho
 logy\, a branch of general psychology\, is just over twenty years old. Not
  much has been done in terms of its application in teaching and learning s
 econd/foreign languages. Positive psychology\, first the movement and now 
 a legitimate branch of psychology (to be distinguished from self-help and 
 pop psychology) derives from the humanistic approaches of\, among others\,
   Abraham Maslow and Jeremy Bruner\, and Gertrude Moskowitz in second/fore
 ign language learning and teaching. Its main aim is to “to understand\, 
 test\, discover and promote the factors that allow individuals and communi
 ties to thrive” (source: Positive Psychology Manifesto\, Sheldon et al.\
 , 2000). Positive psychology is interested in three main areas of study: t
 he positive characteristics and trait of people (here: teachers and learne
 rs)\, positive emotions and feelings\, and the role of contextual factors 
 such as environment\, and in particular\, institutions (e.g. school) and t
 heir functions. Thus\, positive psychology topics embrace the following ar
 eas of study and their applications: “flourishing\, happiness & eudemoni
 a\, hope\, gratitude\, interest\, joy\, wellbeing\, resiliency\, hardiness
 \, and the signature strengths of learners” (Gregersen\, MacIntyre & Mer
 cer 2014\, in preparation). So\, in the case of positive psychology in SLA
  research\, possible topics can focus on positivity as expressed by affect
 ivity in the processes involved\, motivational and attitudinal factors\, t
 he strengths of teachers and learners as facilitative aspects of teaching/
 learning processes\, as well as educational institutions and their functio
 ns enabling success\, the well-being and development of both teachers and 
 learners.\n\nWe are pleased to announce that the following eminent scholar
 s working in the field of second language acquisition and positive psychol
 ogy (indeed forerunners in the field) have kindly agreed to present plenar
 y talks at our conference: \n\nProf. Janusz Arabski \, University of Siles

 sity of Zurich\, Zurich\nProf. Alison Phipps\, University of Glasgow\, Gla

 al on Wednesday the 20 May is recommended). The conference venue will be t

 bounds of the region which contribute to the big picture of language conta

 t only provide a thorough synchronic description of a certain linguistic p
 roperty whose distribution is argued to be areal\, but that equally aim at
  working out plausible diachronic mechanisms which could account for the o
 bserved geographic and genetic distribution of such a linguistic property.

  educational and other contexts\, reflected upon and portrayed in artistic
 -literary-social media\, and acknowledged\, valued\, or rejected in politi
 cal and institutional action. Our graduate student conference engages mult
 ilingualism and multiculturalism with an explicitly critical orientation i
 n order to refine these terms in light of research and practice in literar
 y and visual cultural criticism\, history\, linguistics\, anthropology\, a
 nd second/third/foreign language teaching and learning.\n\nKeynote Speaker

DESCRIPTION:IATEFL Annual conference Manchester 2015\n\nEnglish for Specif
 ic Purposes Special Interest Group (ESP SIG) & BALEAP joint Pre-Conference
  Event\n\nTheme: Employability and transferability in EAP and ESP\n\nEmplo
 yability is a major focus in almost all government policies all over the w
 orld. As a result\, all education providers including vocational and highe
 r education institutions are expected to ensure that their curricula meet 
 employability skills needs in the industry. However\, employability may me
 an different things in different contexts. In the current global job marke
 t\, communication skills is considered one of the key employability skills
  and thus the ability to use English language in employment is a necessity
  given the global status of the language. \n\nIn this context\, it is impo
 rtant to explore what role English language proficiency (academic or occup
 ational) plays in employability and how students transfer such proficiency
  from EAP and ESP to their employment. Addressing this theme of Employabil
 ity and transferability in EAP and ESP\, the IATEFL ESP SIG is organizing 
 its next Pre-Conference Event jointly with BALEAP. \n\nThe PCE aims to exp
 lore some key questions in the field such as How important is ESP for new 
 employees or is more general EFL skills all that employers are looking for
 ? How can universities who need to develop students' EAP help students to 
 transfer their language skills to English for Occupational/ Professional P
 urposes?\n\nThis is the IATEFL ESP SIG's annual Pre-Conference Event (PCE)
  prior to the main conference of the IATEFL. We expect that our PCE theme 
 will bring together a diverse range of researchers and practitioners in pr
 ofessional and academic English to share their views\, and practices which
  are applicable to other EAP and ESP contexts.

DESCRIPTION:Following the May tradition established some thirty years ago\
 , we are pleased to invite you to our Szczyrk conference\, which is the 28
 th International Conference on Foreign and Second Language Acquisition (IC
 SFLA). The main theme of this event will be:\n\nLife-long learning: the ag
 e factor in second/foreign language acquisition and learning\n\nDiscussion
  on the role of age in the context of second/foreign language learning has
  been going on for a long time now\, both from a theoretical and an empiri
 cal perspective. A major part of age-related research focuses on the natur
 al setting for L2 acquisition (bilingual children) or on the early start i
 n foreign language learning (formal classroom instruction). Much less has 
 been said about the late start\, about in the third age of learners (50+).
  Although we welcome presentations on different age groups in FL learning\
 , we would very much like to focus on older learners\, following the idea 
 of life-long education and third age universities as the major agents invo
 lved in late adult FL instruction\, supported very strongly by European Un
 ion initiatives. The answer to the question\, Am I too old to learn a new 
 language? is categorically No.\n\nApart from the leading theme\, we would 
 also like to welcome those scholars who are working in the area of multili
 ngualism and multilingual language acquisition (MLA) and who research in t
 his promising fairly new area of study. As it was in the past years\, we a
 re planning to have a special section on multilingualism. These presentati
 ons can embrace both theoretical and empirical studies of multilingual iss
 ues.\n\nIf your research interests lie beyond the main theme of the confer
 ence\, and if you do not work in multilingualism\, you can also submit a p
 roposal in other areas of second language acquisition (SLA) and foreign la
 nguage learning (FLL). The proposals for these presentations will also be 
 reviewed by us and considered for acceptance as presentations at the confe
 rence.\n\nOver the past three years we have also been working with Ph.D. s
 tudents\, giving them a chance to share their thesis proposals and researc
 h ideas with academic facilitators and other PhD students. We plan to hold
  a continuation of our Ph.D. workshop\,as the response to it has been over
 whelmingly positive. The event will be facilitated by scholars experienced
  in the supervision of doctoral projects in second language acquisition. T
 he workshop is open to all Ph.D. students in SLA/MLA\, but also those in T
 EFL/TESOL\n\nWe are pleased to announce that the following well-known scho
 lars working in the field of second language acquisition have kindly agree
 d to present plenary talks at our conference:\n\n- Prof. David Green \, Un
 iversity of London\n\n- Prof. Carmen Munoz\, University of Barcelona\n\n- 
 Prof. Rebecca Oxford\, University of Maryland \n\n- Prof. Simone Pfenninge
 r\, University of Zurich\n\n- Prof. David Singleton\, Pannonia University/
 Trinity College\n\nThe conference will be held in our usual place\, the ho
 liday resort ofSzczyrk in the Beskidy Mountains\, southern Poland. The dat
 es are 19 to 21 May 2016 (arrival on Wednesday the 18 May is recommended).
  The conference venue will again be the Hotel META. All conference partici
 pants will be accommodated there.

 /de re distinction\, linguists point out the overwhelming variety of forms
  languages employ for this purpose (viz. 51 forms for ‘I’ in Japanese\
 , 27 in Thai). Firstly\, honorifics for the first person (e.g. in Thai\, K
 orean\, or Vietnamese) enable the speaker to refer to herself not in an im
 mediately-given way. Secondly\, in languages such as Amharic and Chinese\,
  first-person pronouns can be used to attribute the immediate access to on
 eself to a third party.

DESCRIPTION:This two-day conference on case attraction and related phenome
 na will take place on Friday 18 and Saturday 19 September 2015 at the Univ
 ersity of Wrocław.\n\nThe conference will explore the whole range of phen
 omena traditionally described in terms of 'case attraction'\, together wit
 h the history of the subject. The aim is to bring together scholars intere
 sted in case attraction and related phenomena\, often in different traditi
 ons and different parts of the world\, to try to communicate across differ
 ent perspectives and frameworks and explore a subject of common interest. 
 The conference will include a history of scholarship dimension\, alongside
  theoretical and typological contributions.\n\nAn extraordinary amount of 
 work on (so-called) case attraction of the Greek relative pronoun was done
  in the late 19th and early 20th centuries\, by a circle of scholars assoc
 iated with Richard Förster. Förster was trained in Breslau (Wrocław) in
  the 1860's. Like a near-contemporary of his\, Isidor Krause\, he devoted 
 his doctoral dissertation to case attraction. Förster went on to devote h
 is Habilitationsschrift to the subject\, and this remains a substantial so
 urce of good observations\; he later wrote about similar phenomena in Lati
 n too. Förster held posts in Rostock (1875–1881)\, Kiel (1881–1890) a
 nd finally his alma mater Breslau (1890–1922). Over several decades he i
 nspired many pupils and other scholars\, both in Breslau and elsewhere\, t
 o work on case attraction of the Greek relative pronoun in classical and p
 ost-classical authors. (A bibliography of these works is available on requ
 est from Philomen Probert: philomen.probert@wolfson.ox.ac.uk.)\n\nThere is
  now considerable interest in case attraction cross-linguistically\, and a
 ncient Greek remains central to the discussion. The descriptive generalisa
 tions on which the modern work depends were first worked out by the schola
 rs of Förster's circle. The contribution of these scholars tends to be fo
 rgotten\, yet not all their observations have found their way into the sta
 ndard handbooks. Furthermore\, modern scholars working on the subject are 
 often working in different traditions from one another\, with different pe
 rspectives and terminology.\n\nThis is a joint event of the Center for Gen
 eral and Comparative Linguistics at the University of Wrocław and the Phi
 lological Society\, and is generously supported also by the Faculty of Lin
 guistics at the University of Oxford and the UCLA Program in Indo-European
  Studies.\n\nConfirmed invited speakers are Professor Markus Bader (Frankf
 urt)\, Professor Josef Bayer (Konstanz)\, Professor Henk Van Riemsdijk (Ar
 ezzo)\, and Professor Ralf Vogel (Bielefeld).

SUMMARY:Clause Structure in the Caucasus and Asia Minor

DESCRIPTION:Clause structure is one of the most widely studied phenomena w
 ithin formal syntactic theory. There seems to be a consensus among mainstr
 eam generative syntacticians that three functional heads v°-T°-C° and t
 he structural layers associated with them constitute the clausal domain. E
 ach of these layers is commonly assumed to play their own specific role in
  syntactic derivation: arguments are introduced and get their thematic rol
 es assigned within vP\, TP grounds the event in aspectual and temporal dom
 ains\, CP is responsible for finiteness and discourse-related phenomena. H
 owever\, a number of problems regarding clause structure in general and pr
 operties of each of the three layers remain unresolved\, for example\, whe
 ther v° and Voice° are different heads\, whether ergative is a structura
 l or inherent case\, and where it is assigned\, what the locus of gender a
 nd person agreement is\, etc. A standard way to foster theoretical researc
 h is to bring new data and evidence from previously un(der)described langu
 ages. The Caucasus and Asia Minor are evident lacunae in this respect\, si
 nce most languages of the area\, with some rare exceptions\, are still ter
 ra incognita for theoretical syntax. Still\, even the first glimpses into 
 the languages of the area show that they have much to offer as for the typ
 ology of clause architecture: long distance agreement in Tsez (Polinsky 20
 01\; Polinsky\, Potsdam 2001)\, unconventional preverb movement in Chechen
  (Komen 2007)\, unusually consistent raising of verbal arguments out of vP
  to the specifiers of functional projections and preverb properties in Hit
 tite (Sideltsev forthcoming)\, to name just a few.\n\nInvited speaker: Pro

DESCRIPTION:Reconstruction of segment inventories of languages and descrip
 tion of sound changes (e.g. from PIE to daughter languages) often date bac
 k a century or more\, from a time when linguistic insights were radically 
 different from the ones of today. Nevertheless\, analyses of 19th and earl
 y 20th century scholars are often taken for granted. This discrepancy is a
 lso reflected in the present-day division between historical linguistics a
 nd synchronic linguistics: whereas in\, e.g.\, Indo-European or Uralic lin
 guistics one often focuses on isolated phenomena\, a more systemic vision 
 prevails in synchronic linguistics. At the same time\, many synchronic pho
 nologists are usually still not very interested in descriptions of histori
 cal phenomena. In more recent times\, some attempts have been made to brid
 ge this gap. In historical linguistics systemic approaches have at least b
 een advocated more and more since Martinet 1955 (cf. also Back 1991) but h
 ave still not been very much applied (like in Greenberg 2000 or Kobayashi 
 2004). In theoretical phonology\, approaches such as evolutionary phonolog
 y (Blevins 2004) have tried to profit from the data and insights of histor
 ical linguistics and include them in the modeling of phonology. In Honeybo
 ne & Salmons (to appear) there will also be various contributions of this 
 kind. The aim of the present workshop proposal is to strengthen these deve
 lopments and make historical linguistics and modern phonology come togethe
 r and benefit from each other. More concretely\, we would like to invite m
 odern analyses of historical phonological phenomena about segment inventor
 ies as well as historical phonological processes.\n\nReferences:\n\nBack\,

DESCRIPTION:Latin has been the reference language of western Europe for ce
 nturies\, serving as the source for recurrent waves of direct or indirect 
 influence on the syntax\, morphology and lexicon of many national language
 s. Solodow (2010) addresses the influence of Latin on the lexicon and the 
 morphology\, but does not pay due attention to the role of Latin syntactic
  patterns in shaping European syntax. More than half a century after Blatt
 ’s (1957) seminal paper on “Latin influence on European syntax“\, an
  in-depth typology of the various Latinization strategies has yet to be pr
 oposed. This workshop aims to take a step in that direction\, identifying 
 and explaining different types of contact between Latin syntax and the syn
 tax of the western European languages from an historical and geographical 
 perspective. Special attention will be paid to (i) the type of contact and
  the level of linguistic analysis\, (ii) the periodization of Latin influe
 nce and the role of translation\, (iii) the actualization of new Latin-bas
 ed constructions\, (iv) the question whether the SAE Sprachbund is influen
 ced or determined by Latin-based features\, and (v) the repercussions of t
 he study of Latin loan syntax for functionalist explanations of language c
 hange.\n\nConvenors:\n\nBert Cornillie (KU Leuven)\nBridget Drinka (Univer

 ways in which public texts\, both historical and modern\, encoded the soci
 al identities of people in their various interlocutive roles. Social ident
 ity is understood as an individual's self-concept derived from perceived m
 embership in a social group. In language use\, social identity constructio
 n can be traced through linguistic indicators\, such as stance\, person re
 ference\, modality\, and others. Public texts\, such as newspapers\, instr
 uctional texts\, prose and drama\, can show people’s social selves on di
 fferent levels of intergroup behaviour. The main interest lies on how writ
 ers of these texts place themselves and the people they are either writing
  about or for within different social categories.

  the hope of re-establishing communication between generations in the enda
 ngered language\, and other age-groups\, who identify with the cultural co

  'new' speakers can therefore often have a marked effect on the existing e

  only. These particles have been quite well studied\, especially from a fo
 rmal semantic point of view (e.g. Reis & Rosengren 1997\, Krifka 1999\, va
 n der Sandt & Geurts 2001\, Rullmann 2003\, Sudhoff 2010\, Winterstein 201
 0\, Winterstein & Zeevat 2012). However\, some recent studies indicate tha
 t additive particles in non-European languages may have a much broader ran
 ge of application than those in English (Lahiri 1998\, Göksel & Özsoy 20
 03\, Demeke & Meyer 2008\, Tosco 2010\, van Putten 2013\, Öpengin 2013\, 
 Konnerth in press\, Forker submitted). Cross-linguistically\, recurrent fu
 nctions of additive particles include non-scalar additivity (corresponding
  to English also\, as well\, too)\, scalar additivity (English even)\, the
  marking of concessive clauses\, indefinite pronouns (free-choice\, univer
 sal\, negative)\, topic switch and/or contrast\, and NP coordination.\n\nA
  major goal of this workshop concerns the agenda to better understand as w
 ell as disentangle the multifunctionality of additives: First\, are there 
 additive particles with functions other than the ones mentioned here? Seco
 nd\, how do additive particles develop historically - do they tend to orig
 inate with one of these functions and then take on others? What types of e
 lements historically originate from additive particles? Third\, what are o
 perationalizable definitions of the various functions? A fourth question i
 s whether multifunctional additive particles may be described as having a 
 single more abstract function which unites their various uses.\n\nAnother 
 important line of research into additives is their interaction with inform
 ation structure and their role in discourse organization. Additive particl
 es have been called focus particles or focus-sensitive particles (see e.g.
  König 1991)\, but it has also been noticed that they may associate with 
 topics (Krifka 1999\, Dimroth 2002\, van Putten 2013). How the particles i
 nteract with other categories of information structure may differ from lan
 guage to language and warrants further investigation. The functions of add
 itives in discourse organization and processing have not been studied much
  (but see Dimroth 2002\, Eckardt & Fränkel 2012 for experimental approach
 es). Some questions are whether and to what extent additives are obligator
 y (see also Kaplan 1984)\, what their role is in increasing discourse cohe
 rence and what functions they may have in conversation. \n\nIn addition to
  the functions and information-structural properties of additives\, a numb
 er of other research questions are highly relevant to understanding the ph
 enomenon of additive marking. Some interesting problems to address are:\n\
 n- Which (experimental\, corpus-based\, or other) methodologies can we use
  to study additive particles?\n- What are the morphosyntactic properties o
 f additives: what types of constituents do they associate with and what ty
 pes of constructions do they occur in?\n- What does a typology of additive
 s look like? Are there functions that are more common than others in parti
 cular genetic or areal units?

SUMMARY:Budapest Conference on Projection and Representation in Syntactic 
 Theory

DTEND;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20150414T000000
UID:http://linguistlist.org/issues/25/25-4305.html
DESCRIPTION:The notion of projection in generative linguistic theory has f
 or the most part been a matter of stipulation. In syntax\, X-bar theory co
 dified the projection of a head to a phrase\, via an intermediate projecti
 on level involving complementation\; adjuncts could freely be added to the
  structure via the adjunction operation. Movement of a phrase into the per
 iphery of a higher projection involved either substitution for a specifier
  position or adjunction\; either way\, the target of movement was guarante
 ed to project\, by virtue of the X-bar-theoretic principles. In the minima
 list program\, the requirement that the target of movement project was der
 ived independently\, and X-bar structure was simplified or abolished altog
 ether (Kayne 1994\, Chomsky 1995:Chapter 4\, Brody 1998\, 2000). Without X
 -bar structure stipulating the organization of syntactic phrases\, fundame
 ntal questions arise regarding the nature of and constraints on projection
 . Projections might not have to have a (unique) head. Perhaps the labellin
 g problem posed by XP–YP structures could help derive a central ingredie
 nt of the standardly adopted derivation of long-distance filler–gap depe
 ndencies: successive-cyclic movement (Chomsky 2013). Thus exploited\, prob
 lems of projection may then turn from explanandum into explicans.\n\nThe n
 otion of projection is centrally tied in with the representation of syntac
 tic structure. Are syntactic structures projected from a head to a phrase\
 , or are phrases traced back to their heads? Are filler–gap dependencies
 \, constructions in which an element is pronounced in a position in which 
 it seems unable to perform its role as an argument\, predicate or modifier
 \, derived via upward displacement of the filler or instead base-generated
  in a representational approach that traces the filler from its pronunciat
 ion position back to the gap (see Brody 2002 for critical discussion)? The
  derivational approach has had the upper hand in the generative approach\,
  leading to the postulation of intermediate links in a chain derived by su
 ccessive-cyclic movement. The applicability of the derivational approach t
 o all cases of apparent displacement has frequently been called into quest
 ion\; the successive cyclicity that the standard approach embodies has bec
 ome the subject of debate as well. If non-derivational approaches are desi
 rable for certain cases\, perhaps a purely representational approach would
  be applicable to all filler–gap dependencies uniformly. With this comes
  the prospect of the grammar and the parser being folded into a single mec
 hanism for the building of structures and the dependencies within them.\n\
 nThis conference is held in honour of the 60th birthday of Michael Brody. 
 It will feature talks by invited speakers from Brody's circle (former and 
 present colleagues and students) who have contributed to questions of proj
 ection and representation in syntactic theory. In addition\, the conferenc
 e will have a poster session that is open for submissions on any topic rel
 ated to the theme of the conference (projection and representation in synt
 actic theory).

DESCRIPTION:Approaches to language classification in the Americas have flu
 ctuated considerably over the past 100 years. The beginning of the 20th ce
 ntury saw a sense of urgency in proposing long-distance relationships\, mo
 st of which were not supported by sound empirical evidence (e.g.\, Sapir 1
 921). In contrast\, towards the end of the 20th century confidence in the 
 viability of this kind of enterprise was increasingly waning\, marked by p
 ublications such as Campbell and Mithun (1979) and Campbell (1997). More r
 ecent years\, however\, have seen a renewed interest in taking up the chal
 lenge of understanding the linguistic past of a continent usually taken to
  be one of the linguistically most diverse areas of the world. Recent prop
 osals have tended to be cautious\, paying more detailed attention to the p
 resentation and analysis of the materials on which they are based\, as com
 pared to much of the earlier work in the area. Some examples include the p
 roposed links between Harakmbut and Katukina (Adelaar 2000) and between To
 tozoquean and Chitimacha (Brown et al. 2014)\, as well as the Macro-Jê af
 filiation of Jabutí (Ribeiro and van der Voort 2010). Such advances have 
 in no small measure been possible because of the improved availability and
  quality of descriptive data. Current descriptive research on poorly docum
 ented languages\, particularly in South America\, will similarly allow for
  more progress in the understanding of the linguistic prehistory of Native
  America. Moreover\, philological analysis of materials available for exti
 nct and/or poorly documented languages has the potential to improve our un
 derstanding of their histories. Finally\, computational methods have recen
 tly supplemented the toolkit of traditional historical linguistics\, promi
 sing new ways of systematically arriving at potentially viable hypotheses 
 in this field.\n\nA keynote address will be delivered by Prof. dr. Willem 
 F. H. Adelaar (Leiden University).

DESCRIPTION:In the field of language acquisition studies\, mainly two big 
 grammatical theories seem to be opposed: Generative Grammar and Constructi
 on Grammar. Whereas GG is to assume highest possible economy in language p
 rocessing (e.g. low processing costs for automatical syntactic processes i
 n comparison to lexical-semantic ones)\, especially concerning language ac
 quisition\, the «efficiency principle» does not seem to be of great impo
 rtance in CG. However\, examining the ideas of CG more closely\, we will i
 dentify efficiency in a different way (e.g. always the same procedures of 
 acquisition processes\, no separation between lexicon and grammar).\n\nBas
 ed on the question in what respect economy is crucial in processes of lang
 uage acquisition\, we want to discuss if it is possible to establish a gra
 mmatical theory that combines both approaches. Such a model could potentia
 lly answer several questions concerning language acquisition in a more eff
 icient and more accurate way.

DESCRIPTION:SALA-31\n\nGeneral Information:\n\nThe South Asian Languages A
 nalysis (SALA) Roundtable is a long-established annual meeting for the dis
 semination of research of all kinds into the languages of South Asia. The 
 first SALA Roundtable was organised in 1978 at the University of Illinois\
 , Urbana-Champaign\, and since then SALA has been hosted by a long list of
  institutions in North America\, South Asia\, and Europe.\n\nThe thirty-fi
 rst South Asian Languages Analysis Roundtable (SALA-31) will be held at La
 ncaster University from Thursday 14 May to Saturday 16 May 2015. \n\nSALA-
 31 aims to present a range of contributions from right across the spectrum
  of linguistic disciplines\, on as inclusive a basis as possible. We consi
 der any kind of descriptive\, theoretical\, or applied linguistic research
  concerning one or more of the languages of South Asia – broadly defined
  – to be within scope for this event. \n\nThe following speakers have ac
 cepted our invitation to give plenary lectures at SALA-31:\n\n- Miriam But
 t\n- Carol Genetti\n- Sonal Kulkarni-Joshi\n- Ulrich Pagel and Nathan Hill
 \n\nSALA-31 will be held on the Lancaster University campus\; see http://w

DESCRIPTION:These are interesting times for the study of formal aspects of
  verse. On the one hand\, many new techniques are being employed to uncove
 r new kinds of data\, for instance experimentally\, or by use of large cor
 pora. On the other hand\, many different kinds of conceptual frameworks ar
 e brought in to apply on such data\, ranging from cognitive psychology to 
 literary analysis\, and from linguistic theory to acoustics. Old debates r
 evive and new questions arise.  How can we study verse forms? How can we c
 reate a typology of forms across languages and cultures? What explains uni
 versals and variation within this typology? How can we make sure that our 
 data can be exchanged most easily across researchers?\n\nIn this perspecti
 ve\, we are pleased to invite you to the workshop The Structure of Verse\,
  organized at Leiden University in the framework of the Horizon project Kn
 owledge and Culture. The two-day workshop aims at bringing together schola
 rs and graduate students interested in formal aspects of poetry\, song\, c
 hant and related phenomena\, including typological\, experimental and comp
 utational approaches.\n\nThe workshop will comprise two distinct albeit co
 nnected sessions:\n\n19 March: Encoding and decoding verse: structure and 
 perception of metered poetry\n20 March: Encoding verse digitally: how to b
 uild\, use and connect corpora\n\nInvited Speakers:\n\nNigel Fabb\, Univer

DESCRIPTION:Avec l’essor des études de genre\, les recherches sur le ra
 pport entre genre et langue se trouvent aujourd’hui largement écartelé
 es entre deux axes. L’un – le plus récent\, mais dont la fréquence d
 ’usage dans le discours sociétal semble être la plus grande – se con
 centre sur l’humain et s’attache à montrer notamment comment les repr
 ésentations des identités masculines et féminines se trouvent paramétr
 ées par le linguistique. Un certain nombre d’études font par exemple 
 état d’un biais contre les sujets parlants femmes : mise en évidence d
 e l’asymétrie des genres grammaticaux\, qui se manifeste en particulier
  par l’axiologisation des formes de féminin (ex. entraîneur vs. entra
 îneuse)\, usage des masculins dits génériques qui rendent les femmes in
 visibles\, etc. Le genre apparaît alors comme totalement motivé et\, aux
  yeux de certains\, les analyses sont même transférables aux animaux (ex
 . Bassetti 2013) et aux inanimés (ex. Mathiot & Roberts 1979\, Morris 199
 1\, Romaine 1999).\n\nL’autre approche\, qui part du linguistique\, s’
 intéresse au fonctionnement des systèmes grammaticaux du genre. Elle met
  en avant la notion d’accord\, à l’instar de cette définition souven
 t citée de Hockett (1958) : « Genders are classes of nouns reflected in 
 the behaviour of associated words. » Les systèmes formels\, par exemple 
 celui du français\, sont décrits comme largement arbitraires \; il n’e
 xiste ainsi pas de fondement sémantique au fait que chaise soit féminin\
 , tabouret masculin. Pour l’humain\, le genre suit beaucoup plus réguli
 èrement le sexe (ex. boulangère est féminin et dénote une femme)\, mai
 s il existe dans un certain nombre de langues quelques noms dits « hybrid
 es » ou « conflits » (Wyss 1983\, Corbett 1999)\, dans lesquels le genr
 e grammatical ne correspond pas au sexe \; ainsi le neutre allemand Mädch
 en ‘jeune fille’\, le féminin russe djadja ‘oncle’\, etc. Le genr
 e est plus clairement motivé dans les langues dites à système sémantiq
 ue\, c’est-à-dire dans lesquelles ce sont des critères sémantiques qu
 i président à la répartition des noms en classes de genre. Mais là enc
 ore\, il existe des noms résiduels\, dont l’appartenance à telle ou te
 lle classe n’apparaît pas positivement motivée.\n\nCette journée d’
 études propose d’articuler ces deux approches du genre\, avec la questi
 on suivante : quelle est la part d’arbitraire et de motivation dans la c
 atégorie linguistique du genre ? Celle-ci s’inscrivant plus largement a
 u sein des différents systèmes de catégorisation  nominale\, qui compre
 nd encore les classes nominales et les classificateurs\, elle pourra gagne
 r à être éclairée par l’examen de ces autres systèmes. Par exemple\
 , toute catégorisation par classificateurs est-elle entièrement motivée
  ? Ce regard sur des systèmes qui comportent un plus grand nombre de clas
 ses et qui sont moins hautement grammaticalisés que le genre (Hagège 200
 0) peut d’autant plus préciser certains enjeux liés au genre que l’
 étude du dyirbal suggère que certains systèmes de genre sont issus de s
 ystèmes de classificateurs (ibid.).\n\nIl s’agira notamment de dresser 
 un tableau plus précis des cas de décalage entre genres linguistiques (o
 u autres systèmes de catégorisation) et genres au sens des identités se
 xuelles. Mais au-delà\, cette interrogation quant à la part de motivé e
 t d’arbitraire du genre et autres systèmes de catégorisation soulève 
 plusieurs autres sous-questions (voir détail dans 'call for papers' joint
 ).

DESCRIPTION:International Conference\nParis\, University Paris – La Sorb
 onne\,\nConference organizers : Stéphane Viellard\, Irina Thomieres\n\nTh
 e conference will bring together scholars in a variety of languages on the
  subject of causation and the linguistic resources to express it.\n\nThe c
 onference will address the following topics:\n\n- The identification of ca
 usative verbs\n- Simple causative verbs\, including verbs of feeling\, the
 ir arguments\, their combinatory possibilities\, the opposition 'causative
  verb - non causative verb'\n- The relationship between verbs and their ca
 sual adjuncts\n- In the case of prepositional phrases\, the relationships 
 between preposition and noun (de peur\, par jalousie\, de miedo\, di amore
 \, от счастья\, etc.). What role do analogy and diachronic mechan
 isms play in explaining the way languages function?\n- Verbal phrases\, in
 cluding those expressing feelings (trembler de peur\, rougir de honte\, te
 mblar de miedo\, arrossire di vergogna\, побелеть от гнева\
 , etc.). What is the explanatory value of the theory of prototypes? What o
 ther concepts such as intensity\, polarity\, etc. can help us describe the
 se linguistic units?\n- Similarities and differences between simple verbs 
 and reflexice verbs (attrister – s’attrister\, взорвать – в
 зорваться)\,\n- Causative verbs as mental operators and the expre
 ssion of cause and effect between two events (L’exposition de Picasso su
 scita l’intérêt du public. Torrential rain caused a major flood. Пр
 инятие нового закона привело к массовым 
 забастовкам). Is it possible to establish a typology of verbal 
 operators ?\n- The distinction between ‘agentive’ cause and ‘acciden
 tal cause’\n- In the case of predicative nouns\, particular attention wi
 ll be paid to compound nouns in which one element is the cause of the pred
 icated action: the noise of the engine\, the smell of the sea\, le bruit d
 u moteur\, l’odeur de la mer\, l’odore delle rose\, аромая ча
 я. Is a typology of these units possible? Why do compound nouns and simpl
 e nouns coexist and what are the prerequisites for the appearance\, in a g
 iven context\, of a simple predicate or a compound predicate? Which pragma
 tic criteria must be met to answer this question?\n- The 'zero sign' of ca
 usation\n\nThe linguistic encoding of causal relationships will be at the 
 heart of the conference and it will lead us to discuss a number of essenti
 al questions:\n\n- What does one express? \n- How does one express it and 
 in what respect are languages different? \n- What is the role of subjectiv
 ity? \n- Lexical gaps: can one always express causation?\n\nConference fee

DESCRIPTION:Workshop Proposal SLE 2015 Leiden\nCategorial shifts: From des
 cription to theory and back again. \n\nThe aim of this workshop is to disc
 uss the categorial shifts involved in\, for instance\, nominalization and 
 verbalization\, in view of recent descriptive research. Studies on nominal
 ization/verbalization have tended to be either inductive and crosslinguist
 ic in focus (e.g. Hopper & Thompson 1984\; Mackenzie 1987\; Lehmann 1988\;
  Givón 1990\; Croft 1991\; Koptjevskaja-Tamm 1993\; Dik 1997) or they are
  deductive and theoretically oriented (see\, for instance\, on the English
  gerund: Lees 1960\; Chomsky 1970\; Pullum 1991\; Hudson 2007). This works
 hop wants to pick up on the role of language-particular\, micro-level desc
 riptive studies and probe into the contribution that they can make to our 
 general understanding of categorial shifts. In particular\, informed by la
 nguage-particular studies on categorical shifts (e.g. in the English -ing 
 form)\, it wants to critically examine\n\n(1) whether nominalization and v
 erbalization can be accurately characterized as the ordered acquisition or
  loss of particular hierarchies of nominal or verbal categories (see\, amo
 ng others\, Givón 1990\; Croft 1991\; Malchukov 2004\; 2006)\; \n(2) how 
 the almost exclusively synchronic perspective that has thus far been taken
  on categorial shifts can be linked to diachrony\;\n(3) what the functiona
 l underpinnings are of (trans)categorial shifts\; \n(4) what benefits as w
 ell as limitations there are to a quantitatively-oriented methodological a
 pproach to the description of categorial shifts.

DESCRIPTION:First National Conference on Applied Linguistics and Professio
 nal Practice (NCALPP) will be held at Islamic Azad University\, Kermanshah
  Branch\, Kermanshah\, Iran February 25\, 2015.\n\nThe theme of the confer
 ence will be Integrating Linguistic Research with Language Teaching. Lingu
 istic research and language teaching have generally been viewed as two sep
 arate types of academic endeavors\, each with its own priorities and pract
 ices. While linguists have been preoccupied with uncovering patterns of la
 nguage and building theories of language structure\, rarely are they conce
 rned with issues in language pedagogy. Language teaching practitioners\, o
 n the other hand\, often encounter teaching and learning issues that are n
 ot readily addressed by theoretical linguistic research and find themselve
 s in need of enriching their knowledge about the language for a better-inf
 ormed pedagogy. We believe that it is time now that the integration of the
  two strands of academic endeavors be prioritized\, for a number of reason
 s: a) truly insightful linguistic findings should find their value in appl
 ications such as language teaching\, b) it takes tremendous effort and tim
 e to translate research into practical language teaching\, c) language tea
 ching can raise fundamental questions for linguistic research\, and finall
 y\, d) the proliferation of English language learning and teaching at the 
 global level demands increased linguistic effort and synergy for a deeper 
 understanding of the language and better pedagogies for language teaching.
  Moreover\, the conference aims to bring together scholars from different 
 disciplinary backgrounds\, especially language and communication research\
 , and professional specialties (e.g.\, healthcare\, social care\, therapy\
 , law\, mediation\, management\, business\, journalism\, education). It en
 courages research and reflection developing interdisciplinarity\, methodol
 ogical diversity\, inter-professional collaboration and explores the relat
 ions between language use and social practices taking place in institution
 al and organisational contexts.

DESCRIPTION:During the last decade\, extensive compilation of spontaneous 
 speech corpora for several linguistic families has provided large amounts 
 of data to linguistic research\, often including the acoustic and prosodic
  dimension\, which is fundamental for speech analysis. \n\nSpeech corpora\
 , therefore\, represent a strong enhancement for the development of lingui
 stic theory in several and diversified domains. However\, the notion of se
 ntence as unit of reference for spoken language analysis turns out to be s
 trongly limiting as well as inconsistent with the available data. Differen
 t paradigms point at various possible ways to identify structural properti
 es of spoken language\, including its unit of reference. Starting from dir
 ect comparison of empirical studies on several languages and linguistic fa
 milies\, the workshop intends to advance in the comprehension of the unit 
 of reference for spontaneous speech and to profit from the discussion of t
 he results of multiple theoretical approaches in order to define a common 
 ground.

DESCRIPTION:Complexity Theory is becoming an established perspective in th

 es (most prominently studies of language learning and use in ELT situation
 s). However\, Complexity Theory has not yet been used to directly inform a
 ctual ELT practice and it will remain of limited value to ELT practitioner
 s unless it can generate practical insights deemed as useful by practition
 ers.\n\nThrough a combination of invited presentations and participant dis
 cussion\, the Roundtable aims to identify how Complexity Theory may enhanc
 e ELT practice. Tentatively\, this may include discussion of how Complexit
 y Theory may inform language classroom teaching\, teacher development\, in
 novation in curriculum\, syllabus and materials design\, and the inclusion
  of learners as fuller participants in language education. There will be o
 pportunities for Roundtable participants to add to this tentative agenda.

SUMMARY:Locally Bound Possessives as a Window on Language Structure

DESCRIPTION:The goal of our workshop 'Locally bound possessives as a windo
 w on language structure' is to bring together researchers working in diffe
 rent theoretical paradigms\, language typologists and language specialists
  to discuss the factors governing the cross-linguistic distribution of loc
 ally bound possessives. In the languages of the world this structural posi
 tion can be encoded by a pronominal (as in English Mary saw her cat)\; a d
 edicated possessive pronoun\, often called reflexive possessive (as in Rus
 sian Masha uvidela svoju koshku)\; a genitive form of an argument reflexiv
 e (Avar\, Northeast Caucasian)\; or a head marking (Meadow Mari\, Uralic).
 \n\nThe main empirical questions to be addressed stem from the conjecture 
 that the availability of dedicated possessive reflexives in a language cor
 relates with the way the language encodes definiteness. In other words\, l
 anguages without prenominal definite articles usually employ reflexive pos
 sessives while languages with prenominal articles employ simple pronominal
 s (see Reuland 2011\, and especially Despic (2011) and (forthcoming)\, for
  more discussion).   \n\nCrucial questions include i. to what extent this 
 conjecture holds also if a larger class of languages is considered\, and i
 i. why it would hold. Answers to the 2nd question bear on more fundamental
  issues in our understanding of anaphoric dependencies\, specifically the 
 factors underlying locality of binding domains. More generally we are inte
 rested in how ‘local binding’ of a possessive element is encoded. \n\n
 Topics to be contributed by the participants may include:\n\n- Typology of
  locally bound possessives\n- Reflexive possessives and non-subject antece
 dents\n- Correlation (or an absence thereof) between the binding domains o
 f an argument reflexive and a reflexive possessive\n- Languages where a re
 flexive possessive is a part of a complex reflexive: Is there something ty
 pologically unusual in terms of binding domains and/or possible antecedent
 s? \n- The development of reflexive possessives from a diachronic point of
  view\n- Cross-linguistic variation in the domain of locally bound possess
 ors\n\nThe issue of locally bound possessives can be approached from a num
 ber of different angles. Since the publication of Lectures on Government a
 nd Binding in 1981 the nature of binding and its domains has been in the c
 entre of the linguistic debate.  Basic question one may raise include: Wha
 t is the role of pragmatic versus formal principles? How are interpretive 
 dependencies represented in functional approaches to language? What is the
  division of labour between syntactic and semantic principles? One of the 
 crucial problems for Chomsky (1981) was the abundance of cross-linguistic 
 variation in binding patterns of anaphors even among closely related langu
 ages (e.g. Germanic). Subsequent work\, varying from Reinhart (1983) to Ch
 omsky (1995) raised even more fundamental questions about the way anaphori
 c dependencies are linguistically represented. The nature of this represen
 tation is directly relevant for the question of how we can understand and 
 explain locality conditions on binding.

 \nIUT Saint Omer\, Université du Littoral\, Côte D’Opale\n28\, 29 et 3
 0 May\, 2015\n\nThe desire to make learning “sustainable”\, robust and
  resilient is at the heart of teaching in LSP / LAP (as we can see in rece
 nt European publications on lifelong learning). The English term “sustai
 nability” implies the idea of a natural capital to be preserved\, mainta
 ined\, restored\, managed or developed. The word “durabilité” is a re
 cent import into French\, and may be applied to teaching where tools and r
 esources are provided with the aim of rendering the result and the process
  of learning permanent. \nThe term sustainability calls to mind the idea o
 f ecology\, especially as described by Bronfenbrenner (1979\, 1994). In it
 s broadest sense\, ecology applies to individuals within an ecosystem and 
 the interactions between them\, however language use and language learning
  being social actions\, the question of exchanges between communities is a
 lso unavoidable. Thinking of LSP/LAP in terms of ecology has implications 
 at all levels\, from the individual and his or her interaction within lang
 uage communities to the evolution of language itself (ecolinguistics)\, mi
 crosystems (schools\, universities\, families\, etc.)\, macrosystems (cult
 ure\, the economy\, professional life\, etc.).\n\nWhereas the ideology of 
 inbuilt obsolescence seems to be gaining ground in many areas of life\, ho
 w can we think of learning and teaching languages in ways which will foste
 r the development of durable skills so we can move towards inbuilt sustain
 ability? This is the question which the 37th annual APLIUT conference will
  be exploring.

 “New Spaces.” On the one hand\, globalization has allowed new areas to
  emerge on the map of translation practices\, shifting the cultural center
 s away from the Western world and towards other world regions\, particular
 ly Asia and Latin America\, thereby generating spatial and cultural shifts
  in translation flows. On the other hand\, in virtual space\, the future o
 f translation and interpreting is already being shaped by the interaction 
 of human translators and interpreters with machines. This two-day internat
 ional conference will examine the interactions between the physical and vi
 rtual spaces in which translation and interpreting take place in the 21st 
 century.

SUMMARY:How Lexical Relatedness is Established and Marked: Prosody\, Compo
 sitionality and Productivity

DESCRIPTION:There seems to exist a cross-linguistic tendency in languages 
 which have lexical accent that affixes which are usually associated with i
 nflection are far less commonly accented than those associated with deriva
 tion. As Revithiadou (1999) notes ''the empirical facts suggest that it is
  not very common to have morphemes other than inflectional suffixes marked
  with a weak accent.'' Moreover\, within the traditional domain of derivat
 ion\, accented affixes tend to be characterised by a lesser degree of sema
 ntic transparency and a less predictable applicability (in the extreme cas
 e\, a fully idiosyncratic selection of morphemes they combine with) (Arsen
 ijević & Simonović 2013). In sum\, there is a continuum from accentless 
 all-round morphemes with straightforward semantic content\, to often accen
 ted morphemes with limited productivity.\n\nFor instance\, in English\, Du
 tch and German\, while all inflectional suffixes are unaccented\, the nati
 ve Germanic derivational suffixes\, which are more productive and have mor
 e transparent meaning are mostly accentless (e.g. the nominalising suffix 
 -ness\, -heid and -keit/heit respectively)\, whereas the Latinate suffixes
 \, which combine with a limited number of bases and have a more lexicalise
 d meaning are mostly accented (e.g. the nominalising -ity\, -iteit and -it
 ät respectively). In Serbo-Croatian\, this dichotomy has been observed wi
 thin the native domain: the same suffix can have an unaccented version\, w
 hich is used more productively and with more transparent semantics\, and a
 n accented version\, which is used in more unpredictable combinations with
  lexicalised semantics. \n\nBase word:			     \n\npUtovati ''to travel'' 	
 			\nOpaasan ''dangerous''\n\nParadigmatic nominalisation:\n\npUtovaanje '
 'travelling''\nOpaasnoost ''dangerousness''\n\nNon-paradigmatic nominalisa
 tion:\n\nputovAAnjE ''trip''\nopAAsnOOst ''danger''\n\nArsenijević & Simo
 nović (2013) termed the domain of prosodic base-faithfulness\, productivi
 ty and semantic transparency paradigmatic\, while the domain of accented a
 ffixes\, limited productivity and lexicalised semantics is termed non-para
 digmatic. Their concept of paradigmaticity thus establishes relations betw
 een the phonology\, semantics and productivity of patterns. While quite a 
 few models in morphology (e.g.\, Haspelmath 1995\, Spencer 2013) build on 
 the relations between selectional restrictions\, semantics and productivit
 y\, instead of the traditional opposition between inflection and derivatio
 n\, and a number of models tackle the problems of paradigm uniformity in a
  purely phonological perspective (e.g. Kenstowicz 2005)\, relatively littl
 e attention has been given to the correlation between these three domains.

 ence seeks to examine issues in the ongoing construction of European ident
 ity\, including notions of diversity and (physical and symbolic) borders. 
 It will focus on critical investigations that draw on discourse theory or 
 bottom-up textual analysis to investigate these topics from the following 
 perspectives:\n\n- Historical\, to explore the determinants which have bee
 n used to support a collective European identity\n- Geopolitical\, to unde
 rstand the importance of space and its role in the European edifice\n- Ide
 ological/discursive\, to investigate\, synchronically and diachronically\,
  key concepts that have informed EU practices of inclusion and exclusion\n
 \nMethodologically\, the Conference will highlight discourse as a major pr
 actice that both shapes and reflects European identity. \nThe Conference w
 ill welcome contributions that investigate the role that key European Unio
 n texts have played in forging\, maintaining or challenging European ident
 ities. The Conference will thus highlight identity not as a static concept
 \, but as a construct that is continually negotiated and re-written in mul
 tiple discourses.\n\nIn addition to attracting contributions from discours
 e analysts and linguists\, the Conference hopes to bring together leading 
 scholars and researchers from a broad range of other fields\, including hi
 story\, European studies\, cultural theory\, media studies\, sociology\, p
 olitical science\, and ethnology.  \n\nThe following plenary speakers have

 \, we shift attention to situations of contact in historical settings (cf.
  Braunmüller & Ferraresi 2003\, Kossmann 2013\, Schrijver 2014\, Stenroos
  et al. 2012). In addition\, we seek contributions which do not simply foc
 us on contact-induced changes in the grammatical system\, but which also t
 ake into account the sociolinguistic conditions of the contact (Schneider 
 2007)\, especially the sociolinguistic results of contact between speakers
  and communities of different varieties – in terms of attitudes\, percep
 tions\, ideologies\, identity and planning (Hüning et al. 2012\, Peersman
  et al. to appear 2015\, Rouchdy 2002).

SUMMARY:Root Modality: Expressive Devices and Semantic-Pragmatics

DESCRIPTION:In the literature on modality\, there is broad consensus on ho
 w to distinguish root modality from epistemic modality\, but only little a
 greement on the internal make-up of the root category itself. Various prop
 osals have been put forward\, some of which use the label ‘root modality
 ’ and define further subtypes (e.g. Coates 1983\; Depraetere & Reed 2011
 )\, while others prefer the combination of ‘dynamic’ and ‘deontic’
  modality (and further subtypes) (Palmer 1986\; Nuyts 2006\; Van linden 20
 12)\, or use yet different labels (e.g. Narrog 2012).\n\nIn addition to th
 is considerable number of taxonomies of root modality proposed in the lite
 rature\, the range of types of expressions investigated also has increased
 . While studies on root modality – and modality in general – have trad
 itionally focused on the category of modal verbs\, with the Germanic modal
  auxiliaries as the prototypical cases (e.g. Palmer 1979\; Coates 1983\; G
 oossens 1985\; Heine 1995\; Hansen 1998)\, recently the research scope has
  been broadened – especially in the study of English – to other types 
 of expressive devices\, such as so-called semi- or quasi-modals (e.g. have
  to\, be able to\, be supposed to) (cf. Westney 1995\; Leech 2003\; Leech 
 et al. 2009) and ‘emerging’ modals like have (got) to and want to (e.g
 . Krug 2000\; Verplaetse 2010). Apart from these verb-based expressions of
  root modality\, the last decades have witnessed an increase of studies de
 dicated to non-verbal expression types\, such as complement constructions 
 with ‘modal-evaluative’ adjectives like essential\, necessary\, and ap
 propriate (Van linden 2012)\, verbo-nominal expressions of modality (e.g. 
 have need\, there is need) (Loureiro-Porto 2010\; Van linden et al. 2011\,
  2014)\, and expressions with comparative adverbs (e.g. had better\, would
  rather) (Van der Auwera & De Wit 2010\; Van der Auwera et al. 2013). \n\n
 However\, this diversification of coding types examined has not led to a u
 nified treatment of root modality so far. The aim of this workshop is to m
 ove the debate forward\, to enhance our understanding of the multi-faceted
  nature of root modality\, and to investigate the division of labour betwe
 en the various types of expressive devices language users have at their di
 sposal to express root meanings.

DESCRIPTION:Workshop on Differential marking: implications for Case and Ag
 ree\nSLE workshop\, 2-5 September 2015\, Leiden\n\nOrganisers: András Bá
 rány\, Michelle Sheehan & Jenneke van der Wal\n\nMany of the world’s la
 nguages display differential marking whereby specific kinds of arguments a
 re flagged by case and/or agreement. In some languages accusative/dative c
 ase is used for DOM of objects at the upper end of Silverstein’s animacy
  hierarchy (e.g. Persian\, Spanish\, Hindi) and/or ergative case different
 ially marks subjects at the lower end of the scale (e.g. Dyirbal (Pama-Nyu
 ngan)\, Halkomelem (Salish)\, Mocho’ (Mayan)). In other languages differ
 ential marking is not reflected in the case system but rather in agreement
  morphology\, sensitive to the properties of just the object (e.g. Bantu l
 anguages\, Hungarian\, and other Finno-Ugric languages)\, or of more than 
 one argument (e.g. so-called inverse systems in Algonquian languages).\n\n
 While many of these phenomena have been studied extensively in isolation\,
  less attention has been paid to the relationship between differential mar
 king and abstract Case/Agree. On the one hand\, some scholars have propose
 d that non-accusative marked objects are not targets for Agree as they are
  not DPs but NPs\, which do not require Case-licensing (Danon 2006\, Richa
 rds 2008). On the other hand\, competing accounts take (dependent) case ma
 rking to be a post-syntactic morphological effect\, which is not predicted
  to interact directly with Agree/Case-valuation (Marantz 1991\, but see Ba
 ker 2014 for a syntactic implementation of dependent case). Finally\, othe
 r researchers have argued for a dissociation of Case and Agree (e.g. Baker
  2014\, Bhatt 2005\, contra the mainstream view)\, based on evidence from 
 languages that have both differential agreement and (differential) case ma
 rking like Amharic (cf. Kramer 2014 on Amharic\; cf. also Hungarian). It r
 emains unclear to what extent a narrow syntactic notion of Case or nominal
  licensing is also required under such accounts. For these reasons\, disen
 tangling the relationship between morphological marking and the abstract o
 perations of Case licensing and Agree seems especially difficult but neces
 sary in the area of differential marking.

DESCRIPTION:This workshop aims to bring together researchers working on th
 e (morpho)syntax and semantics of numerals and numerical expressions.\n\nN
 umerals raise a host of linguistic issues of a syntactic\, morphological\,
  and semantic nature. From a syntactic point of view\, they sit on the div
 ide between lexical and functional categories\, and occupy a fixed positio
 n in the extended nominal projection. Morphologically\, they often constit
 ute a productive and fairly transparent category\, but their categorial st
 atus remains under discussion: do they constitute a word class of their ow
 n\, or are they nominal or adjectival in nature? Semantically\, numerals a
 re clearly akin to quantification in general\, but at the same time they c
 an differ from regular quantifiers in being more specific or precise in th
 eir denotation.

SUMMARY:Workshop on Presupposition in Langauage Acquisition at the 38th DG

DESCRIPTION:Presuppositions in Language Acquisition\n\nEvidence from adult
  speakers suggests that apart from standard truth-conditional content\, co
 ntent can also be contributed on the levels of presupposition and of impli
 cature. The organization of these levels as well as the particular analysi
 s of individual expressions w.r.t. these levels are core questions of curr
 ent linguistic research. The investigation of when children acquire which 
 content types helps to determine the general path of language acquisition 
 itself and is central for the theoretical questions mentioned above. Work 
 on the acquisition of implicatures suggests implicated content becomes acc
 essible later than truth-conditional-content (cf. Noveck 2001 a.o.). The p
 resent workshop focusses on the acquisition of presuppositional content\, 
 which so far has received less attention in language acquisition research.
  The question we raise and that papers should address are\, a.o.:\n\n- Dat
 a from adult speakers suggests a distinction between ''semantic'' presuppo
 sitions and ''pragmatic'' presuppositions. Is this distinction reflected i
 n acquisition? Do children acquire ''pragmatic'' presuppositions later or 
 earlier than ''semantic'' presuppositions?\n- At what age do children inte
 rpret sentences with presupposition triggers adult-like? Do we find differ
 ences between the levels of truth-conditions and presupposition in childre
 n?	\n- At what age do children show an adult-like behavior w.r.t. presuppo
 sition projection and accommodation?  \n\nGiven that online methods seem t
 o be especially sensitive for children’s competence methods studies usin
 g online techniques are of particular interest for the workshop.\n\nNoveck

DESCRIPTION:Workshop conveners: Karin Beijering (University of Antwerp)\, 
 Sarah D’Hertefelt (University of Leuven)\, Gunther Kaltenböck (Universi
 ty of Vienna)\, María Sol Sansiñena (University of Leuven)\n\nInvited Sp
 eakers:\n\nPedro Gras (University of Antwerp)  \nMarianne Mithun (Universi
 ty of California\, Santa Barbara)\n\nStructures formally marked as subordi
 nate do not only occur with main clauses as parts of complex sentences\, b
 ut are also used independently. A well-known use of such an ‘independent
  subordinate clause’ is illustrated in the following example from Swedis
 h\, often labelled ‘evaluative’\, ‘exclamative’ or ‘expressive
 ’ in the literature: \n\nSWEDISH (Internet Corpus)\n(1)\nAtt 	du 	aldrig
  	kan 	passa 		tider! 		\nCOMP 	you 	never 	can.PRS	watch.INF 	times\n‘W
 hy can’t you ever keep track of the time!’ (lit.: That you never can w
 atch the time!)\n\nThe independent use of formally subordinate constructio
 ns has been detected and described in a range of languages. Evans (2007: 3
 67) introduced the term ‘insubordination’ to refer to “the conventio
 nalized main clause of use\, of what\, on prima facie grounds\, appear to 
 be formally subordinate clauses”\, and developed a typology of the diffe
 rent functions such structures can fulfill. In recent years\, the interest
  in this phenomenon has increased\, but many questions remain to be addres
 sed. \n\nThe aim of this workshop is to bring together linguists working o
 n different types of (semi-)independent constructions in a range of langua
 ges\, to understand how these different types of structures relate to each
  other\, and whether they can all be considered instances of the same phen
 omenon. More specifically\, the questions we want to address include the f
 ollowing: \n\n- Which different levels of (in)dependence should be disting
 uished (e.g. syntactic\, semantic/pragmatic\, dyadic) in order to adequate
 ly describe different types of (semi-)independent constructions? Can (in)d
 ependence on these different levels always be considered a cline? \n\n- Wh
 at is the grammatical status of these (semi-)independent constructions and
  how can they be accounted for in a grammatical model?\n\n- Different diac
 hronic paths and mechanisms of change have been suggested for the developm
 ent of these different constructions\, e.g. ellipsis of the main clause (E
 vans 2007)\, extension of dependency (Mithun 2008)\, dependency shift (D
 ’Hertefelt & Verstraete 2014)\, cooptation (Heine\, Kaltenböck & Kuteva
  fc.) and hypoanalysis (Van linden & Van de Velde 2014). Are these differe
 nt diachronic hypotheses mutually exclusive? What are the motivations for 
 proposing different hypotheses and how should we proceed to falsify any of
  these through actual diachronic corpus research? Is it possible for any o
 f these constructions to have multiple sources? \n\n- Can structures with 
 different degrees of (in)dependence fulfill similar functions? Can Evans' 
 (2007) typology of functions of insubordination be refined by distinguishi
 ng between different degrees of (in)-dependence?\n \n- The importance of t
 aking a more dyadic approach to the study of (semi-)independent constructi
 ons formally marked as subordinate clauses has been suggested by Gras (201
 1\, fc.) and Gras & Sansiñena (resubmitted)\, among others. What can the 
 contribution of Interactional Linguistics and Conversation Analysis be to 
 the discussion of the development and function of these constructions? \n\
 n- Can the study of the prosody of these constructions help us understand 
 more about their (in)dependent status (see Schwenter fc.)? What kind of pr
 osodic analysis is more appropriate when approaching this issue?

DESCRIPTION:Hypothesis testing using linear mixed effects models\n \nThis 
 workshop is devoted to a detailed discussion of several issues relating to
  linear mixed effects models (LMMs)\, which are widely used in linguistics
 \, psychology\, and cognitive science. An important recent paper in this c
 ontext is Barr et al. (2013). \n\nBarr et al. (2013) have raised a lot of 
 awareness about random effects in LMMs. Their main argument is that LMMs 
 “generalize best when they include the maximal random effects structure 
 justified by the design” (Barr et al. 2013:255). The paper seeks to prov
 ide a simple procedure for defining LMMs for data sets typically seen in p
 sycholinguistic work. In this workshop\, we will attempt to unpack the mai
 n ideas of the Barr et al. paper\, and then move on to discussing the rece
 nt paper by Bates et al. (2015)\, which addresses the question of how to p
 roceed when there is not enough data to recover accurate estimates of the 
 true parameters in the random effects part of the model. Finally\, in the 
 context of LMMs we will discuss the more general question of what the purp
 ose of a statistical model actually is. Psychologists and statisticians ha
 ve\, it seems\, very different answers to this question. A major goal of t
 his workshop is thus to understand what statisticians have to say about st
 atistical models used for hypothesis testing.\n\nThe workshop will consist
  of two parts. We will start with a theoretically oriented lecture followe
 d by a discussion which will focus on the variance-covariance matrices of 
 the random effects in maximal versus non-maximal LMMs. In the second part 
 of the workshop\, we will take up some practical examples. \n\nThe worksho
 p will be led by \nProf. Shravan Vasishth from the University of Potsdam\n

DESCRIPTION:Workshop EUDIA-4 Linguistic Variation in Basque Language and E
 ducation\nBilbao\, Basque Country\nJun 19\, 2015\n\nRegional variation (or
  dialectology) has a long tradition in the Basque language. However\, rece
 nt decades have seen a rapid increase in insights into linguistic structur
 e as well as advances in geographic technology and these two areas have no
 t always been completely matched to each other\, so that one might feel th
 at current linguistic maps leave things to be desired on both sides. Many 
 questions still arise. For instance\, how regions can be identified from m
 apped data? How can geographic information systems best be applied to ling
 uistic data? What can linguistic mapping learn from mapping techniques use
 d in other fields of science? As far as sociolinguistic variation is conce
 rned\, although research about Basque is very recent and it is a growing f

DESCRIPTION:Finite-State Methods and Natural Language Processing - FSMNLP 
 2015 \n12th International Conference \n\nHeinrich-Heine-University Düssel
 dorf\, Germany\nJune 22-24\, 2015\n\nThe international conference series F
 inite-State Methods and Natural Language Processing (FSMNLP) is the premie
 r forum of the ACL Special Interest Group on Finite-State Methods (SIGFSM)
 . It serves researchers and practitioners working on natural language proc
 essing (NLP) applications or language resources\, theoretical and implemen
 tational aspects\, or their combinations that have obvious relevance or an
  explicit relation to finite-state methods.

DESCRIPTION:Aspect vs. verbal and nominal valency\n\nThe aim of the worksh
 op is to bring together researchers representing different theoretical par
 adigms and discuss most recent theoretical developments in the area of val
 ency and aspect related phenomena\, as expressed in clausal structures and
  nominalizations. Spacio-temporal boundedness of an event and its particip
 ants enter into mutual interactions\, which are as complex as they are puz
 zling\, given the fact that these two parameters appeal to dimensions of a
  different character (qualitative and material) (see Lyons 1977\, Tenny 19
 87\, 1992\, Dowty 1991\, Verkuyl 1993\, Lakoff 1970\, Jackendoff 1990\, Ja
 ckendoff 2010). In effect\, the semantic and formal properties of a clause
  and a nominalization arise as minted by the two forces. In this workshop 
 we are planning to bring to light the major interrelations between aspect 
 and valency to gain a better understanding of their spectrum\, characteris
 tics and limitations.

SUMMARY:Shifting Classes: Germanic Strong and Weak Preterites
DTSTART;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20150902T000000

DESCRIPTION:Convenors: Katrien Beuls (Artificial Intelligence Lab\, VUB)\,
  Bernard De Clerck (Ghent University)\, Dirk Pijpops (KU Leuven)\, Freek V
 an de Velde (KU Leuven)\n\nA conspicuous characteristic of Germanic langua
 ges is that they have two morphological strategies at their disposal to ex
 press the preterite. The oldest strategy is called the ‘strong’ inflec
 tion\, and derives from the Proto-Indo-European aspectual ablaut system (E
 nglish sing ~ sang). The ‘weak’ inflection\, by contrast\, is a diachr
 onically innovative strategy in Germanic\, and uses a dental suffix (Engli
 sh work ~ worked). \n\nMost verbs take either the strong or the weak infle
 ction\, but the distribution is historically (as well as socio- and dialec
 tally) in flux: over time\, many verbs have shifted from strong to weak\, 
 or – less commonly – from weak to strong\, or shift from one strong ab
 laut class to another\, or from one weak class to another. The precise dev
 elopments are notoriously complicated.\n\nThe Germanic strong and weak pre
 terite formation has been the subject of numerous studies which have appro
 ached the issue from different angles (philological\, acquisitional\, comp
 arative …) (see\, among others\, Van Haeringen 1940\, De Vriendt 1965\, 
 Seebold 1970\, Tops 1974\, Bybee & Slobin 1982\, Bammesberger 1986\, Pinke
 r & Prince 1988\, Van Coetsem 1990\, Van Santen & Lalleman 1994\, Hare & E

 n & Strik 2014\, Strik 2014\; Pijpops et al. 2014\; Pugliese et al. 2014).
 \n\nThe increasing availability of large text corpora on the one hand\, an
 d recent advances in the field of modelling/simulation on the other hand\,
  have led to a renewed interest in what has always been a popular topic in
  linguistics already. We feel that the time has come to bring researchers 
 together to exchange methods and results that can help us to bridge the ga
 p between different approaches.

DESCRIPTION:Research on information structure in endangered languages pres
 ents some unique challenges\, as the necessary data (text collections\, la
 rge-scale corpora of spoken language) typically do not exist\, so research
 ers are compelled to develop and work with much smaller datasets than are 
 available for large well-studied languages. Despite these limitations\, re
 search on these languages has led to significant theoretical and methodolo
 gical advances in the field of IS.\n\nThis workshop will provide a venue f
 or scholars working on IS in endangered languages to present their researc
 h and collaborate on the development of new methodologies for field-based 
 research.\n\nThe plenary speaker will be Dejan Matic (MPI Psycholinguistic
 s)\, whose work focuses on IS in the endangered languages of Siberia\, as 
 well as theoretical aspects of IS.

DESCRIPTION:Reasoning for the 7th FL Teaching and Research Mini-Conference
  in Matsuyama\n\nIn this age of internationalization and globalization it 
 is important to use all means and media to bring quality research and inno
 vative practices not only to big urban centers\, such as Tokyo\, Berlin\, 
 Peking or New York\, but also to smaller cities\, such as Matsuyama in the
  southwest of Japan\, with their\, despite the ubiquitous internet\, still
  limited opportunities. Thus\, as its goal\, this conference aims at prese
 nting up-to-date international quality research and learning and teaching 
 methods and practices to the local and regional foreign language researche
 rs and teachers. It is also meant to be a place where local researchers an
 d teachers can present their work\, approaches and results to a world-wide
  audience\, in presence or over the internet.\n\nThis exchange is crucial 
 in the field of foreign language learning and teaching\, as many component
 s of it are simultaneously in a constant flux and keeping up-to-date is cr
 ucial: The learners and teachers\, the target language(s)\, the practices 
 employed to implement these\, and the research\, the methods and their res
 ults as they have to be applied.\n\nAbout the FL Teaching and Research Min
 i-Conference in Matsuyama\n\nThis conference at Ehime University aims at p
 resenting up-to-date international quality research and learning and teach
 ing methods and practices to the local and regional FL researchers and tea
 chers. It is also meant to be a place where local researchers and teachers
  can present their work\, approaches and results to a world-wide audience\
 , in presence or over the internet. The presentations and/or their write-u
 ps are made available to the public on the organizer’s Ehime University 
 homepage at http://web.iess.ehime-u.ac.jp/katudouhoukoku.html.

DESCRIPTION:The Texas Foreign Language Education Conference (TexFLEC) at T
 he University of Texas at San Antonio is an annual conference that brings 
 together researchers\, educators\, and students in the fields of foreign l
 anguage education\, TEFL/TESL (Teaching English as a Foreign or Second Lan
 guage)\, linguistics\, and applied linguistics. TexFLEC provides conferenc
 e participants with the opportunity to share diverse up-to-date ideas.\n\n
 Bridging the gap between research and practice is an inevitable challenge 
 in the field of foreign/second language pedagogy. TexFLEC unites scholars 
 and educators from diverse contexts who strive to connect research finding
 s to classroom practices\, thus shaping the future direction of language e
 ducation.\n\nTexFLEC welcomes research studies and practice-oriented prese
 ntations that clearly establish strong connections between theory and prac
 tice in diverse contexts. Our goal is to offer an interdisciplinary forum 
 for all those interested in research findings with implications for the cl
 assroom as well as those interested in pedagogical approaches to language 
 learning grounded on empirical findings.\n\nWe are very excited to announc
 e our list of keynote speakers. Please help us welcome Dr. Bonny Norton fr
 om the University of British Columbia. She will be talking about her recen
 tly published book ''Identity and language learning: Extending the convers
 ation''.\n\nWe will also have Dr. Juliet Langman who is Professor of Appli
 ed Linguistics in the Department of Bicultural-Bilingual Studies at the Un
 iversity of Texas at San Antonio. Her research interests focus on minority
  youth populations in multilingual settings\, exploring the intersection b
 etween language use\, language learning\, and identity. \n\nThe last but n
 ot the least\, we will have Dr. Elaine K. Horwitz who is Professor of Curr
 iculum and Instruction and Director of the Graduate Program in Foreign Lan
 guage Education at the University of Texas at Austin. She teaches courses 
 in language teaching methodology\, second language acquisition\, language 
 testing\, and second language research methods.

 eece and in the European South in general and therefore many young people 
 leave their country in order to work in businesses either in Europe or on 
 other continents. This mobility however\, if regarded as a factor that pro
 motes the professional competitiveness of young people\, enriching their k
 nowledge and skills abroad and allowing them to transfer their interlingua
 l and intercultural experience to other businesses or back to their countr
 y\, leads us to the conclusion that the knowledge of one or more foreign l
 anguages is one of the pillars of young people's creativity and adaptation
  in the workplace.\n\nOn the other hand\, a great number of businesses app
 ear to be deficient in their staffing with people who know foreign languag
 es and possess intercultural and interpreting skills\, thus losing busines
 s opportunities for agreements.\n\nThese data give rise to the following q
 uestions\, which are some of the main issues in which the scientific commu
 nity is invited to present relevant papers. Within this framework\, the fo
 llowing questions are divided into three main topics:\n\n1) Working enviro
 nment and languages for professional purposes\n2) The Institutional role o
 f languages for special purposes\n3) Teaching LSP and specialized translat
 ion

SUMMARY:The Diversity of Multiverb Constructions In and Across Languages

DESCRIPTION:Title: The diversity of multiverb constructions in and across 
 languages\n\nComplex predicates continue to be a challenge to formal model
 s of grammar as well as to functionally typologically oriented frameworks\
 , despite numerous studies over the years. In the case of formal models\, 
 the challenge is how to account for two or more elements functioning toget
 her as a predicate in a mono-clausal construction. For typologically orien
 ted models\, the variation and diversity of forms that behave this way do 
 not lend themselves to a crosslinguistically valid characterisation. Studi
 es of these forms over the years have shown that there are areal types of 
 such constructions\, e.g. Papuan (Pawley 2008\, Senft 2008)\; Oceanic (Cro
 wley 2002\, Brill & Ozanne-Rivierre 2004)\; Australian (McGregor 2002\, Sc
 hultze-Berndt 2000)\; South Asian (Butt 1995\, 2010) Southeast Asian (Bisa
 ng 2009)\; North East African (Amha and Dimmendaal 2006)\; West African (A
 meka 2005)\, Americas (Aikhenvald and Muysken & Birchall 2010) etc.  But i
 t is hard to identify features that will apply across these languages to i
 dentify the construction type. \n\nOne thing that continues to exacerbate 
 these definitional and analytical problems is that we do not as yet have d
 escriptions of the full range of verbal constructions in individual langua
 ges\, the linguistic landscape within which these joint predication monocl
 ausal constructions function. The focus has been on particular instantiati
 ons of the structure.

 istiques à la disposition du locuteur qui souhaite exprimer la causalité
  ? Le colloque se déclinera selon les axes suivants :\n\n- Les critères 
 distinctifs qui permettent d’identifier les verbes causatifs\n- Les verb
 es causatifs simples et la mise en parallèle ‘verbe causatif – verbe 
 non causatif’\n- Le rapport entre un verbe donné et les compléments de
  cause qu’il régit et\, s’agissant des syntagmes prépositionnels\, e
 ntre la préposition et le substantif (de peur\, par jalousie\, de miedo\,
  di amore\, от счастья\, etc.). Quel est le rôle du raisonnement
  par analogie et des mécanismes diachroniques dans l’explication des fa
 its langagiers ?\n- Les locutions verbales\, et notamment celles qui expri
 ment la manifestation d’un sentiment (ex. trembler de peur\, rougir de h
 onte\, temblar de miedo\, arrossire di vergogna\, побелеть от г
 нева\, etc.). Quel est l’apport explicatif de la théorie des protot
 ypes ? Quelles autres notions\,  telles que intensité\, polarité\, etc. 
 peuvent aider à décrire ces unités linguistiques ?\n- Le rapport ou l
 ’absence du rapport d’équivalence entre un verbe simple et un verbe p
 ronominal morphologiquement proche\n- Les verbes causatifs qui ont le stat
 ut d’opérateurs et la façon d’exprimer le rapport de cause à effet 
 entre deux événements  (ex. L’exposition de Picasso suscita l’intér
 êt du public. Torrential rain caused a major flood. Принятие но
 вого закона привело к массовым забастов
 кам). Comment établir une typologie des opérateurs verbaux ?\n- La di
 stinction ‘cause agentive – cause événementielle\n- S’agissant des
  noms prédicatifs\, on prêtera une attention particulière aux noms comp
 osés dans lesquels un des éléments correspond à la cause du procès [a
 u sens large] exprimée par le prédicat : le bruit du moteur\, l’odeur 
 de la mer\, the noise of the engine\, the smell of the sea\, l’odore del
 le rose\, аромая чая\, etc. Comment procéder à une typologie de
  ces unités ? Pour quelles raisons les noms composés et les noms simples
  coexistent et quelles sont les conditions sine qua non de l’apparition\
 , dans un contexte donné\, d’un prédicat simple ou d’un prédicat co
 mposé ? Quels critères pragmatiques doivent être invoqués pour répond
 re à cette interrogation ?\n- Le ‘signe zéro’ de la cause

SUMMARY:Special session on Perspectival expressions and the de se at the 2

DESCRIPTION:This special session on perspective and the de se across langu
 ages has two purposes: i) to provide a forum for discussion among research
 ers already working in this area and ii) to introduce the topic to a wider
  audience and stimulate cross-linguistic research on perspectival expressi
 ons. The session includes five invited talks\, plus a poster session immed
 iately following the talks.\n\nRecent work on indexicals by Wechsler (2010
 )\, Bittner (2012)\, and Roberts (2014\,2015)\, on logophoricity by Pearso
 n (2013)\, and on deictic motion verbs by Barlew (2015a) argues that these
  expressions are anchored to the doxastic [belief-related] point of view o
 f a salient agent in discourse\, and that they are de se (Lewis 1979).  Th
 is characterization has potential application to a broader class of lingui
 stic phenomena often assumed to be perspectival\, including deixis\, locat
 ives (Levinson 2003\; Sundaresan & Pearson 2014)\, motion verbs (Fillmore 
 1975\; Oshima 2006a\,b)\, shifted indexicals (Rice 1986\, Schlenker 2003\,
 2014\; Anand & Nevins 2004\, Zucchi 2004\; Quer 2005\,2011\; Sundaresan 20
 11\, 2012\; Sudo 2012\; Deal 2013)\, logophoricity (Sells 1987\, Speas 200
 4\, Pearson 2013) and empathic reflexivization (Kuno 1973\,1973\; Kuroda 1
 973\; Tenny 2006\; Nishigauchi 2014)\, egophoricity (Hargreaves 2005\, Flo
 yd et al. to appear)\, and Free Indirect Discourse (Eckardt 2014)\, with s
 yntactic and semantic reflexes across many languages.  By suggesting a uni
 fied approach\, recent developments promise to realize the integrative vis
 ion of Lyons (1977)\, earlier localists (see Fortis 2012)\, Fillmore (1975
 )\, and Mitchell (1986).  And they demonstrate that a proper understanding
  of perspective-sensitivity has broader implications for work in semantics
  (e.g. perspectival content associated with CIs—Potts 2005\, Amaral\, Ro
 berts & Smith 2007\, Harris & Potts 2009\; Koev 2015\; and evidentials and
  epistemic modals—Kierstead 2015\, Roberts 2015) and philosophy of langu
 age (where Relativism relies on evidence from predicates of personal taste
  and other perspectival expressions—Kölbel 2002\; Lasersohn  2005\; Ega
 n\, Hawthorne\, & Weatherson 2005\;  MacFarlane 2007\, 2014).

 um\n\nSpace\, place and discursive action within social media/real life co
 mmunicative environments\n\nGuest speakers: \n\nMarcel Burger\, University
  of Lausanne\; Richard Fitzgerald\, University of Macao\n\nThe broad theme
  of this colloquium is the discursive organisation\, representation and ne
 gotiation of space/s and place/s as interactional practices within the onl
 ine environments of social media.\n\nWorking interactively in these enviro
 nments (FB\, Twitter\, Flickr and Instagram\, online news\, chat and comme
 nt forums\, specialised sites such as ‘Tripadvisor’\, virtual game wor
 lds) is an increasingly routine aspect of how we communicate socially\, wi
 thin work\, as work and with institutions. Life-logging\, geo-tagging and 
 moving in and out of virtual spaces have become commonplace practices for 
 many\, while many organisations\, from newsrooms to universities to tax of
 fices\, have joined the socially mediated ‘scene’.  \n\nAs yet\, the r
 elationship between online and offline interactive environments\, and the 
 forms of discursive actions and interactions that occur within and between
  them\, are only just beginning to be explored. Existing linguistic resear
 ch has tended to focus on the relationship between digital technology and 
 the performance of social identity-ies\, on corpus approaches to the analy
 sis of ‘e-language’\, and on the narrative character of discourse with
 in the social media. While this research is developing apace\, less attent
 ion has been paid to other forms of representation\, action and interactio
 n that take place in and through the digital spaces/places of the social m
 edia\, where multi-modal posting and sharing practices serve to organise a
 ctions and interactions within an increasingly permeable virtual/real comm
 unication environment.

 f Erlangen (Germany)\nTitle: ''Migrant students as at-risk learners: Myth 
 or reality?''\n\nThe interest in multilingual individuals and societies is
  certainly one of the greatest hallmarks characterizing the last decade. A
 lthough several studies have shown qualitative differences between the acq
 uisition of English as a first foreign language and the subsequent acquisi
 tion of a second foreign language\, the various assets of English as one o
 f the languages of the multilingual repertoire have been under-researched.
 \n\nThe new approach of the multilingualism of the European Union advocate
 s the ideal of a multilingual European citizen\, speaking her or his mothe
 r tongue as well as two other (European) languages\, resulting in the incr
 ease in individual multilingualism. Among the research topics identified b
 y the EU Commission are the language competence of adults\, the knowledge\
 , and use of the multiple languages at the level of the individual speaker
 \, as well as on a societal level (a bounding and shifting continuum). Hen
 ce\, the treatment of English as a crucial language in the multilingual wo
 rld over centuries has been wide-ranging\, encompassing linguistic facets 
 of individual\, cultural\, sociological\, educational\, and psychological 
 dimensions.

DESCRIPTION:ESP: Needs\, Pedagogy\, and Assessment\n\nRationale:\n\nGlobal
 ization and integration among countries\, both at the regional and global 
 level\, have opened up business opportunities as well as opportunities for
  various forms of collaboration among world citizens. Due to the breaking 
 down of economic barriers and the coming of the Asean Economic Community (
 AEC) in 2015\, the importance of skilled labour in a variety of specific f
 ields within ASEAN is growing. Stakeholders in English language teaching a
 nd learning – from policy makers and language institutes to students and
  workers from different professions – have come to realize that English 
 proficiency will be one of the essential factors to developing the potenti
 al of both individuals and the nation.\n\nRecognizing the role English for
  Specific Purposes (ESP) will play in meeting this need\, together with th
 e auspicious occasion of the 60th birthday anniversary of HRH Princess Mah
 a Chakri Sirindhorn\, who has been the royal patron of activities and proj
 ects related to English language teaching and learning\, in the year 2015\
 , Chulalongkorn University Language Institute (CULI) is organizing the CUL
 I International Conference 2015 to encourage those involved in English lan
 guage teaching and learning to revisit and reevaluate current teaching met
 hods as well as develop a more effective\, creative education system. With
  our main focus on the workshops and presentations\, this year’s confere
 nce will be a platform for English language educators at all levels to sha
 re their ideas and experience in teaching English within ASEAN\, as well a
 s within the global framework\, in order to enhance the competitiveness of
  all citizens in the new labor market and to take English language teachin
 g and learning in the region to another level.\n\nObjectives:\n\n1. To cel
 ebrate the auspicious occasion of the 60th birthday anniversary of HRH Pri
 ncess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn\n2. To present participants with an opportuni
 ty to meet leading speakers on ELT and listen to their views concerning ES
 P\n3. To provide a platform for ELT professionals to share their insights\
 , best practices\, and challenges regarding ESP\n4. To offer participants 
 an opportunity to network with colleagues in the ELT profession\n5. To sti
 mulate further research in ELT in ASEAN countries and beyond\n\nOnline reg

 sted states are both taken as indicators of more likely reconstructions. I
 n fact\, many early typologists argued that typology should be the foundat
 ion of reconstruction\; Roman Jakobson (1958: 23)\, for example\, believed
  that typology is a crucial predictive tool\, and thus a reconstruction th
 at conflicts with it is ''questionable.'' Indeed\, some typologically orie
 nted scholars are of the opinion that\, in cases where a reconstruction co
 ntradicts a strong cross-linguistic tendency\, the reconstruction must be 
 reevaluated or discarded. Many scholars\, like Jakobson himself\, do not d
 efend the requirement that reconstructions conform to typological results\
 , beyond arguing\, as Greenberg does\, that ''it is a highly suspicious ci
 rcumstance that a language not directly attested\, but only reconstructed 
 by a complex line of reasoning\, should not conform to well-attested synch
 ronic typological principles'' (1995:146). The idea that a feature can be 
 reconstructed only if it is already attested elsewhere\, while never fully
  discussed in the literature\, is repeated even in recent works in the rel
 atively new subfield of diachronic typology (for example\, Hendery 2012:24
 5).  At the same time\, however\, some historical linguists reject this id
 ea\, suggesting instead that typology can be used as a tool in the reconst
 ruction process\, but should not necessarily override the results attained
  via internal or comparative reconstruction (Compare here the debate withi
 n Indo-European linguistics over the glottalic theory.)

DESCRIPTION:DiGS17 will be held at the University of Iceland\, Reykjavík\
 , 29–31 May 2015. It is hosted by the Institute of Linguistics at the Un
 iversity of Iceland.\n\nDiGS (Diachronic Generative Syntax) is an establis
 hed international conference dedicated to the investigation of historical 
 syntax and syntactic change from a generative perspective. Papers on synta
 ctic change in real time and syntactic change in heritage languages are es
 pecially encouraged this time.\n\nDiGS17 will be preceded by a workshop en
 titled The Second Workshop on Formal Ways of Analyzing Variation\, FWAV2\,
  on 28 May. The FWAV-workshop is a venue for research that relates linguis
 tic variation and formal analysis. FWAV2 aims to follow up on the success 
 of FWAV1\, which was held in Reykjavík 2013\, and as FWAV2 is co-located 
 with DiGS17\, it is hoped that some of the workshop presentations will mak
 e use of the various historical treebanks that are familiar to many resear
 chers in diachronic syntax. For further information see the conference web
 site.\n\nInvited speakers at the conference:\n\nCharles Yang (University o

DESCRIPTION:In recent CALL articles\, conference presentations and project
  proposals\, we notice a renewed interest in activities\, and less emphasi
 s on technology or theoretical pedagogy. These activities\, elective or co
 mpulsory\, can be subdivided into three partly overlapping categories: (a)
  focus-on-form tasks which can be defined as meaningful tasks in which the
  focus on particular forms is tightly embedded\; (b) focus-on-meaning task
 s which should lead to communication (CMC approach) or any kind of non-lin
 guistic outcome (TBLT approach)\; and (c) form-focused exercises that focu
 s on isolated forms\, such as improved and enriched (drill-and-practice) e
 xercises.\n\nDuring this conference we will discuss the design process beh
 ind these tasks: How do we decide on task types? How do we shape them? How
  do we monitor and evaluate them?

 University of Texas at Austin\n\nSALSA is an annual symposium promoting li

 . Originally created through the joint efforts of students from the Lingui

 , educational psychology\, media studies\, speech communication\, and nume
 rous language departments. Our annual proceedings appear in special editio
 ns of Texas Linguistic Forum.\n\nThis year’s theme is Language and Borde
 rs. Language is intimately connected with human existence\, and as such\, 
 is found at the borders of all areas of human interaction\, and even at th
 e borders of what it means to be human. What sorts of borders exist among 
 people\, places and institutions? What are the forces and ideological unde
 rpinnings that shape and sustain the existence of such borders? How is lan
 guage related to the bounds of human endeavor? What defines the boundaries
  of language itself? SALSA XXIII will explore these questions from a varie
 ty of viewpoints.\n\nThis year's presenters will be:\n\nSalikoko S. Mufwen

SUMMARY:The Sociolinguistics of Kurdish

DESCRIPTION:The sociolinguistics of Kurdish\n\nConvenors: Margreet Dorleij
 n and Michiel Leezenberg\n\nThe fact that the Kurds are the largest nation
  in the world without a state of their own has given rise to a number of d
 istinctive\, and possibly unique\, sociolinguistic features of their langu
 age. This panel aims at exploring some of these\, and invites scholars wor
 king on Kurdish sociolinguistics to submit proposals concerning their rese
 arch. \n\nThe new states that emerged after World War had different strate
 gies of dealing with their Kurdish population groups\, ranging from repres
 sion and assimilation to literization and standardization. In early Soviet
  Armenia\, which only had a minute Kurdish minority\, the Kurmanji dialect
  was developed into a fully functional medium for education\, printing\, a
 nd broadcasting in the late 1920s and early 1930s. The fledgling republic 
 of Turkey\, by contrast\, pursued the most radically repressive policy\, b
 anning the public and private use of Kurdish in 1925\; this ban remained i
 n place until the 1990s\, and its effects can still be seen today. In Iraq
 \, a Southern dialect of Kurdish became an official language during the Br
 itish mandate period\; subsequent Iraqi regimes have not been able to undo
  or revert this official recognition of Kurdish. Remarkably\, however\, th
 e present-day Kurdish Regional Government\, which has had a constitutional
 ly recognized autonomous status since 2005\, has thus far largely refraine
 d from formulating\, let alone pursuing\, any substantial linguistic polic
 ies. In Iran\, Kurdish can be studied at universities\, and books of Kurdi
 sh poetry can be published\; but the use of Kurdish in elementary educatio
 n and in administration has not been allowed.\n\nGiven these varying polic
 ies\, the actual use of Kurdish is subject to a number of constraining fac
 tors. Although many Kurds dream of a unified and independent Kurdish state
  with a unified language\, at the same time\, there is considerable resist
 ance from speakers of different dialects against proposals to create and i
 mpose a unified spoken and written variety.\n\nGiven this situation\, an e
 xplicitly sociolinguistic approach towards the diversity of the linguistic
  situation of the Kurds is bound to yield fruitful insights.\n\nFor exampl
 e\, the persistence of variability and contestation of attempts at standar
 dization may be fruitfully employed by having recourse to some of the more
  recent approaches in sociolinguistics that question long-held assumptions
 . Thus\, Peter Trudgill’s recent ‘sociolinguistic typology’\, (2011)
  which provides an alternative against the assumption of the equicomplexit
 y of languages\, or Jens Norman Jorgensen’s  model of ‘polylanguaging
 ’ (Jorgensen et al. 2011) which provides an alternative for the structur
 alist belief in languages as ultimately impenetrable holistic structures\,
  and other recent  approaches seem to offer fruitful ideas when dealing wi
 th standardisation in the linguistically diverse area that Kurdistan is.

  the Gap: \nIntersections\, Convergences\, and Dialogues\nApril 10-11\, 20
 15\n\nThis year’s conference provides a forum in which to share research
  that bridges gaps within and between the fields of Spanish and Portuguese
  Literature/ & Culture and Linguistics. GRAPHSY 2015 will build on this th
 eme by examining the ways in which research crosses physical\, linguistic\
 , and psychological divides. These breaches can be geographical or ideolog
 ical\, gaps in our knowledge or students’ knowledge\, or areas of resear
 ch that have not been fully explored. We aim to narrow gaps in our knowled
 ge and form connections between individual disciplines.

SUMMARY:English & Multilingualism in 21st Century Europe

DESCRIPTION:The conference aims to tackle one of the most controversial an
 d potentially impactful debates in contemporary Europe. English is growing
  rapidly within\, and spreading across\, an increasing number of societal 
 domains. Such a development is impelled by actions taken by national and s
 upranational decisions-makers\, as well as global forces outside the contr
 ol of any one state or union. Europe’s founding principle of respecting 
 and fostering diversity and equality of cultures and language is being imp
 inged by English’s growing role across European countries\, creating a d
 e facto linguistic hierarchy and consequently a potential cultural hierarc
 hy. This conference aims to uncover and stimulate debate on the current st
 ate of affairs in Europe regarding English and the nurturing of multilingu
 alism. By bringing together academics and practitioners from multiple ling
 uistic and cultural backgrounds\, it is envisaged that a current snapshot 
 of English and multilingualism can be presented in addition to an explorat
 ion of the challenges\, opportunities and controversies that such a situat
 ion brings with it.

DESCRIPTION:Postcolonial literature (variously termed as Commonwealth Lite
 rature or New Literatures in English) started with the examination of lite
 rature produced under the influence of colonizers during the colonial rule
 \, but has expanded into a multi-disciplinary engagement covering even the
  literatures produced in settler colonies of yore. The colonized-colonizer
  paradigm has been transferred to the ruling structures within the freed c
 ountries to address the plight of the subaltern. The ideology of postcolon
 ialism has impacted other ideologies like Marxism\, Feminism and Nationali
 sm besides re-writing concepts like diaspora\, subjectivity\, etc. There i
 s the emerging perception that the colonized phase needs to be viewed as a
  negotiation which developed hybrid positions on both sides like any other
  normal historical phenomenon. We have reached a stage where there is talk
  of post-postcolonial phase. Now is the appropriate time to debate all the
 se developments and variations and assess the fine nuances of theory vis-
 à-vis politics involved.

 he storage and manipulation of large linguistic resources and datasets pos
 sible. The use of Natural Language in Software Engineering has contributed
  to both improving the development process from the viewpoints of develope
 rs (improve the process of conceptual modeling\, validation\, etc) and the
  usability of applications by users (natural language query interfaces\, e

DESCRIPTION:« Human 2.0 »\, « hybrided » or « augmented »\, « post/
 transhumanism »\, « robotic artifacts » of the behavior of communicatin
 g and active man\, abundance of touch-screen interfaces: many are today th
 e humanoid « avatars » and other imitations of human presence. So many i
 dentity and self-image issues\, with\, at both ends\, either a promotion o
 r an alteration of bodies. So many questions are involving also the relati
 ons between the body’s discourses with the subjects of language. \n\nThi
 s symposium aims to establish a dialogue between social sciences\, neurosc
 iences and engineering sciences. This dialog is anchored within the contex
 t of a certain societal urgency: in fragmenting our approaches to the body
 \, do we not also weaken the unity of man and of his conceptions? In follo
 wing with previous events linked to similar themes (Researcher in situ\, I
 mmersion through body\, Norms and deviancies\, Montpellier\, 2014\; Intera
 cting bodies\, Lyon\, 2005)\, this international meeting proposes to broac
 h the relation between body\, language and technique\, within the framewor
 k of an unprecedented interdisciplinary dialogue. \n\nIn this perspective\
 , and because it takes an interest in language related events in their lin
 k to social action\, including technical knowledge (Duranti\, 2002\; Forne
 l\, 1994\; Goodwin\, 2000)\, in its diversity (Bornand & Leguy\, 2013\; La
 font\, 2004\; Londei & Santone\, 2013)\, linguistic anthropology takes a c
 entral position\, postulating a continuity of communicating bodies\, perce
 iving\, feeling\, thinking\, interacting with both natural and artificial 
 environments\, in an analytic perspective aiming to avoid the atomizing of
  study subjects and their contextual uprooting. Through its interdisciplin
 ary nature\, this perspective is able to open a dialogue between the diffe
 rent approaches. In this way\, the studies in this field\, which are alway
 s anchored in an ethnographic context\, interrogate the expressions of rat
 ionality and praxis (Goody\, 1996/1999)\, in particular in investigations 
 of affects and developmental difficulties (Ochs\, 1989\; Ochs & Solomon\, 
 2010)\, of intentionality (Duranti\, 2015) and of mediated interactions (J
 ones & Schieffelin\, 2009\; Verdier\, 2014). Most surely\, the models deve
 loped in action neurosciences\, as well as the works in engineering and ro
 botics would benefit in being discussed through the outlook of these conte
 xtualist approaches (Kockelman\, 2013). \n\nResearchers that question the 
 discourses to the body within the framework of human-machine interactions 
 are strongly encouraged to participate (Suchman\, 2007): for example\, phi
 losophic works (Andrieu\, 2008\; Andrieu & Berthoz\, 2011)\, sociologic (L
 e Breton\, 2013)\, in communication sciences (Renucci\, 2014) or neuroscie
 nces (Damasio\, 2010)… One will crossover research in bodily techniques 
 – of which depends language practice – and in action\, mimics or the v
 oice of the living body and the body that is lived. With a dialogue betwee
 n works on enaction (Varela & al.\, 1991\; Bottineau 2010) and on emersiol
 ogy (Andrieu\, 2015)\, the aim will be to discuss the manner in which soci
 al interactions are linked to linguistic resources and thus insure human e
 xistence through the entanglement of the body and the thought processes th
 at accompany it.

 ue and cooperation toward a better understanding of the role of grammar in
  the organization of the brain\, the existence and characterization of a c
 ritical period in language\, and the property of linguistic theories and l
 anguage processing models in describing language capacity as a separate co
 gnitive system or as accounts of brain computation at different levels of 
 abstraction. We also aim at discussing the new contributions of neuroscien
 ce in the identification of species-specific brain pathways that support l
 anguage computation. \n\nThis event is in honor of Jacques Mehler\, a wise
  thinker who has never been intimidated by the daunting task of studying l
 anguage acquisition even before it is manifested.

 ial Session:\n\nThe topic of this year's special session is “Exploring t
 he (un)expected: The role of informativity in language production and comp
 rehension.” This special session takes as its starting point the notion 
 of informativity\, broadly construed. Not all parts of an utterance are eq
 ually informative. Some parts may be low in informativity because they are
  highly predictable or refer to already-mentioned information. Other parts
  may be more informative because they are unexpected or introduce new enti
 ties. Speakers have to make choices (largely unconsciously) about how to s
 tructure their utterances -- e.g.\, what word order and referring expressi
 ons to use. Comprehenders are faced with the task of extracting the intend
 ed structure and meaning from a signal with fluctuating levels of informat
 ivity. A growing body of research suggests that informativity has intrigui
 ng effects on many levels (phonological\, lexical\, syntactic\, discourse)
  on both comprehension and production\, leading us to ask how these effect
 s can be captured by theories of sentence processing\, whether they can be
  unified\, and what they tell us about effects of (or lack thereof) commun
 icative pressures on language processing and grammar.  \n\nWe are very gra
 teful for funding from the National Science Foundation for the Special Ses
 sion.

 aser University\n\nSpeakers:\n\nPeter Carruthers (Maryland)\nWolfram Hinze
 n (Barcelona/Durham)\nFriederike Moltmann (CNRS/NYU)\nAnna Papafragou (Del
 aware)\n\nConference Overview\n\nSerious and detailed proposals concerning
  the relationship between language and thought—or\, as it might be put t
 oday\, the language-cognition interface—have recently emerged within the
  cognitive sciences. Within linguistics\, for example\, a program of resea
 rch broadly known as the “Minimalist Program” is underway whose guidin
 g assumption is that the computational system of language is only as compl
 ex as it needs to be to meet the demands of the cognitive systems it inter
 acts with\, making it crucially important for the study of language to hav
 e some understanding of what these cognitive systems are like. Within psyc
 hology\, a complementary research program concerns the relationship betwee
 n language and our core cognitive systems. This program investigates how l
 anguage is implicated in the emergence of distinctively human representati
 ons that cut across these core systems (i.e.\, domain-general representati
 ons)\, making it crucially important for these investigators to have some 
 understanding of what language is like such that it can be recruited to th
 is task. These programs illustrate the way that serious thinking about the
  language-cognition interface is rapidly changing the sorts of questions w
 e can ask about the nature of distinctively human thought.\n\nThe aim of o
 ur three-day conference is to explore a wide range of questions at the int
 ersection of linguistics\, psychology\, and philosophy that might be raise
 d in connection with these and other lines of research into the place of l
 anguage in the architecture of the mind. So\, for example\, a key claim ma
 de within the core-cognition framework is that language exhibits none of t
 he modular limitations of the core systems that make use of it. How is thi
 s to be reconciled with the common assumption that language is a modular s
 ystem? Moreover\, it is standard for Minimalists to assume the existence o
 f substantive constraints that emerge from the systems of thought with whi
 ch language is assumed to interact. But to what extent is it explanatory t
 o appeal to an antecedent system of thought to explain linguistic phenomen
 a? Could a more radical view of the connection between language and though
 t be sustained? More generally\, we might ask how these and other programs
  of research should shape our inquiry into language and the mind. Should t
 he philosophy of mind be accorded a larger role in the study of language t
 han it typically is? Should the philosophy of language play a more signifi
 cant role in the study of the mind?

DESCRIPTION:Conference Theme:\n\nOver recent decades\, linguistic and soci
 olinguistic research has been transformed by an increasing focus on the so
 cial\, cultural and linguistic changes brought about by globalisation\, in
 creased mobility\, transnational flows\, new technologies and a changing p
 olitical and economic landscape. These changes have had major implications
  for the ways in which we conceptualise the relationship between language 
 and society in the twenty-first century. A new communicative order has eme
 rged in which we find new types of speakers\, new forms of language and ne
 w modes of communication. The conference theme addresses the challenges an
 d opportunities that this new communicative order presents to researchers 
 working with Spanish and situations of Spanish in contact in the twenty-fi
 rst century. In addition to papers related to the conference theme\, we al
 so welcome any other submissions that are related to Spanish in Society.\n

 s of such possible factors through which hominins have gained a degree of 
 specificity that is not found in other forms of animal communication and c

DESCRIPTION:La deuxième édition du colloque international « La dia-vari

 ’U. de Neuchâtel sous le titre « Approches sémantiques et morphosynta
 xiques de la variation en français actuel. Traitement idéal des données
  dans les ouvrages de référence (dictionnaires / grammaires) ». \n\nCad
 re de la rencontre :\n\nL’Observatoire du français en Suisse romande et
  le Centre de dialectologie et d’étude du français régional de l’Un
 iversité de Neuchâtel organisent du mercredi 4 novembre au vendredi 6 no
 vembre 2015 la deuxième édition du colloque international DIA du frança
 is actuel.\n\nOn souhaite accueillir\, pour l’édition de 2015\, des exp
 osés axés prioritairement sur des cas ciblés de variation lexicale\, mo
 rphologique et/ou syntaxique. Les analyses théoriques devraient idéaleme
 nt être suivies d’une réflexion relative au traitement qui paraîtrait
  le plus apte à refléter\, dans les dictionnaires et les grammaires\, le
 s spécificités linguistiques (sémantiques\, morphologiques et syntaxiqu
 es) et non linguistiques des cas de figure examinés. Par exemple\, quelle
 s seraient les informations sémantiques\, morphologiques et syntaxiques 
 à inclure dans les ouvrages en question afin d’y refléter\, au mieux\,
  les spécificités des phénomènes traités ? Sous quel format ces infor
 mations devraient-elles se présenter ? Suffirait-il d’accoler aux phén
 omènes examinés une marque d’usage pour ensuite les intégrer aux type
 s d’ouvrages de référence déjà existants sans autre forme d’aména
 gement ? N’y aurait-il pas risque\, en pareil cas\, d’obtenir l’effe
 t inverse à celui désiré\, c’est-à-dire la possibilité d’induire 
 une lecture qui stigmatise un usage banal qu’on cherchait simplement à 
 décrire ? Ne devrait-on pas\, plutôt\, envisager la constitution d’ouv
 rages de référence ciblant préférentiellement tel ou tel « sous-syst
 ème langagier » ? Mais dans ce cas\, ne risquerait-on pas d’entrainer 
 une prolifération d’œuvres aux contenus se recoupant en partie ? …\n
 \nLe colloque ne sera pas limité à l’étude de phénomènes propres à
  l’oralité. Toutefois\, le comité organisateur souhaite insister sur l
 ’intérêt que représente l’examen de la langue parlée\, notamment e
 n contexte informel\, pour la thématique générale qui y sera abordée. 
 Cette forme de langue étant souvent reléguée au second plan dans les ou
 vrages de référence\, il y a donc ici doublement matière à réflexion 
 : réflexion quant à la façon de présenter\, dans ces ouvrages\, les fa
 its de variation observés\, d’une part\, et réflexion quant à la mani
 ère d’y intégrer ce qui caractérise en propre la langue parlée en co
 ntexte informel\, d’autre part.\n\nConferenciers invites :\n\nMarie-Jos

DESCRIPTION:The Depling conference responds to the growing need for a conf
 erence dedicated to dependency-based approaches in linguistics and natural
  language processing. In the past decade\, dependencies\, directed labeled
  graph structures representing hierarchical relations between morphemes\, 
 words or semantic units\, have become very widespread in natural language 
 processing. However\, the linguistic significance of these structures ofte
 n remains vague\, and the need to discuss the theoretical and formal found
 ations of dependency-based concepts is felt strongly by many people workin
 g in these domains. Previous Depling conferences were held in Barcelona 20
 11 and in Prague 2013.\n\nIn general terms\, the conference will investiga
 te:\n\n- The use of dependency structures in the description of linguistic
  phenomena\, especially in a cross-linguistic perspective\, in particular 
 linguistic phenomena for which classical phrase structure models have prov
 en to be unsatisfactory\n- The modeling of lexical phenomena and their rol
 e in dependency-based linguistic theories\n- The application of dependency
 -based approaches to natural language processing\, including machine trans
 lation\, parsing\, generation\, information extraction\, etc.

  which should handle all instances of context-sensitivity or do natural la
 nguages contain different ways of accommodating different types of context
 -sensitivity?\n\nAre the kinds of thought experiments Charles Travis has f
 amously used in arguing for pervasive context-sensitivity robust? In light
  of recent scepticism about the role of intuitions as data for philosophic
 al theories\, are Travis-cases open to challenge in this regard? Are there
  intercultural differences in intuitions about Travis-cases? In what ways

DESCRIPTION:The future of the International Corpus of English (ICE) projec
 t – \nNew challenges\, new developments\nRobert Fuchs and Ulrike Gut\, U
 niversity of Münster\n\nMore than 20 years have passed since the late Syd
 ney Greenbaum laid the foundations of the International Corpus of English 
 (ICE) project (Greenbaum 1991). The project\, with its aim to facilitate t
 he comparison of the national standard and standardising varieties of Engl
 ish around the globe through the compilation of comparable 1 million word 
 corpora\, has been a resounding success – if numbers are anything to go 
 by: the compilation of 13 subcorpora has been completed to date\, with 13 
 more in the works\, and Google Scholar indexes more than 3\,200 publicatio
 ns making reference to the ICE project and its subcorpora.\n\nSince 1991\,
  the theoretical and practical contexts of research on varieties of Englis
 h have changed\, and with it the demands that researchers might make on a 
 corpus that allows them to compare the national varieties of English used 
 in countries around the world. Progress in computer technology allows us t
 o use corpus data for analyses that might have been hard to envisage in th
 e 1990s\, such as the analysis of pragmatic and prosodic features (Kallen 
 and Kirk 2012)\, as well as time-aligned annotation with tools such as ELA
 N (Brugman and Russel 2004\, Wunder et al. 2010)\, which allows corpus use
 rs access to the original recordings for phonetic or prosodic analyses. Pr
 ogress in corpus compilation theory makes corpus creation faster and more 
 reliable (Voormann and Gut 2008)\, and new corpus compilation techniques p
 ermit the collection of data from internet sources to create mega-corpora\
 , such as the Corpus of Global Web-based English (GloWbE\, Davies and Fuch
 s 2015). In addition to technical developments\, the evolution of varietie
 s of English also prompts researchers to ask new questions or seek new ans
 wers to old ones. How should the ICE project\, for example\, treat nationa
 l varieties that cannot easily be classified as English as a Second and En
 glish or English as a Foreign Language\, such as English in Cyprus and the
  Netherlands (Buschfeld 2013\, Edwards 2014)?

DESCRIPTION:The International Society for Language Studies will hold its b
 iennial conference from June 18-20\, 2015 at the Hotel Albuquerque at Old 
 Town. The theme of the conference will be “Critical Language Studies: Fo
 cusing on Community.” \n\nLanguage is more than the words that are commu
 nicated from one to another. Language represents our identity in terms of 
 our relationships with others\, how we are connected to others\, power bet
 ween individuals or groups\, and so forth. A critical examination of the c
 onnection between language and society also requires a critical considerat
 ion of the ways in which language and community are linked. Community is d
 efined differently across disciplines and in varying situations\, and as s
 uch we invite scholars to engage in discussions about how what community m
 eans in their respective areas of research and to explicitly discuss how t
 heir presentation is relevant to their understanding of the relationship b
 etween community and language.

SUMMARY:Rethinking Democracy in Literature\, Language and Culture

DTEND;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20150517T000000
UID:http://linguistlist.org/issues/25/25-4873.html
DESCRIPTION:Theories of democracy seem to be as varied as the wide-ranging
  debates over the viability of a democratic system. Since the time of Aris
 totle and Plato a significant number of philosophers and social theorists 
 have investigated notions of autonomy and selfhood\, the role of the state
 \, the degree of egalitarianism and individual power\, as well as the issu
 e of liberal acquiescence to undemocratic political practices. This last i
 ssue has gained momentum in the present day when the humanistic values tha
 t democracy has always claimed as a priority are challenged by neoliberal 
 politics and interventionist economic policies.\n\nIt is the aim of this c
 onference to contribute to the existing – and growing – body of though
 t on the theory and workings of democracy from the perspective of the huma
 nities\, approaching democracy not only as a political system but as a mal
 leable ideological construct open to interpretation and renegotiation. We 
 are especially interested in exploring the role of literature\, art\, cult
 ure (from paintings and films to television ads\, computer games and the s
 ocial media)\, philosophy and language in producing\, disseminating\, resi
 sting and even rethinking democratic ethics\, ideologies and narratives ac
 ross different historical periods\, genres of representation and cultural 
 (Anglophone) spaces. Finding ourselves caught up in the midst of a politic
 al and economic upheaval that has witnessed a surge in “undemocratic” 
 legislative\, cultural or affective responses to difference in traditional
 ly “democratic” societies in the West\, we seek to probe into and high
 light the representational politics of democracy\, the processes through w
 hich democratic ideas of equality\, freedom and justice have become narrat
 ivised\, (mis)interpreted and inscribed into signifying systems\, cultural
  practices and meaning-making processes. It is in this context that this c
 onference will seek to examine not only how literature and art have respon
 ded to democratic institutions but equally how different modes of represen
 tation have contributed to the fashioning of different historically-situat
 ed and culturally-bound models of democratic conduct and sensibility. Have
 \, for example\, digitalization and the unlimited access to information vi
 a the internet contributed to the creation of more tolerant contemporary 
 “cyber-democracies” which identify the democratic with the visible and
  the known? Or\, is surprise and risk-taking still an integral aspect of d
 emocratic ethics in fictional and artistic representation as much as in cu
 ltural patterns of behavior—to follow Jacques Rancière’s thinking?

DESCRIPTION:2nd Kashmir International Conference on Linguistics will be he
 ld on 04-05 May 2015\, at City Campus Muzaffarabad. The conference is mand
 ated to promote lesser known languages spoken in the region as well as maj
 or languages. What is currently known as the Muzaffarabad Division\, occup
 ies a strategic position linguistically as it is located in the centre of 
 Gilgit-Baltistan\, the Hazara region and the Kashmir valley which are home
  to languages spawning from diverse families\, becoming the richest areas 
 of the world in terms of linguistic diversity. It is also striking to noti
 ce how languages have undergone changes as a result of their long contact 
 with other languages and how their relative positions are changing. The li
 nguistic behaviour also provides a window on social behaviour of the speak
 ers. It is in this context\, the major theme of the conference has been ch
 osen as Language Variation.\n\nThis two-day interdisciplinary conference a
 ims to provide a forum to researchers and practitioners in the areas of th
 eoretical and applied linguistics to present and share their research find
 ings in a stimulating and interactive environment. In addition\, the confe
 rence purports to offer collaborative and networking opportunities to scho
 lars and practitioners and advance new perspectives as well as reflect on 
 current research practices in the field. We are positive that the conferen
 ce will yield results that lead to breaking new grounds and produce enduri
 ng effects. The outcomes of the conference will result in more profound un
 derstanding of these complex linguistic and interactional behaviours. \n\n
 Our highly motivated team of hosts is anxiously looking forward to welcomi
 ng you to Muzaffarabad in May 2015.

 ève\nCornelia Hamann Carl von Ossiezky Universität Oldenburg\n\nDescript
 ion:\n\nWork in generative grammar has highlighted that human beings are e
 ndowed with a peculiar faculty to acquire a language\, grounded in a basic
  principle (Chomsky 2013). Multilingualism is however a characteristic fea
 ture of humans (Paradis 2010 a.o)\, and when more than one language is at 
 stake in the same individual\, the following has been observed:\n\n- While
  one always reaches a complete attainment in one language\, this does not 
 always happen for languages beyond the first (incomplete ultimate attainme
 nt)\n- Features of a language may enter the grammar of another\, steadily 
 or optionally (transfer)\n\nThis workshop addresses the following question
 s:\n\n- Can incomplete ultimate attainment be explained solely in terms of
  the age factor or L2 input?\n- What's the role of principles of data anal
 ysis and efficient computation (Chomsky's 2005 'third factor') in determin
 ing incomplete ultimate attainment and transfer?\n- What differentiates in
 complete ultimate attainment in a language beyond the first with respect t
 o incomplete attainment in non-typical language acquisition?\n- Which mech
 anisms govern the transfer of features from a language to another? To what
  extent does transfer depend on the status of a language with respect to a
 nother or on the specific property transferred? Can a directionality be de
 tected in either case?\n- How are incomplete ultimate attainment and trans
 fer to be characterized with respect to different linguistic sub-modules a
 nd interfaces?\n\nReferences:\n\nChomsky\, N. (2005) Three factors in lang

DESCRIPTION:International Conference “Learning through Online Interactio
 n”\nFocus on instructional design\nGrenoble (France)\, June 4-5-6\, 2015
 \n\nThe fifth session of the EPAL Conference (Echanger pour apprendre en l
 igne / Learning through Online Interaction)\, organized by Stendhal Univer
 sity – Grenoble 3 (Lidilem research group)\, will take place on June 4\,
  5\, and 6\, 2015. \n\nOver the last few years\, the academic community ha
 s been gripped by MOOC-mania and the mass of attendant hype\, which has at
  least had the merit of bringing e-learning back into the spotlight. It is
  against this background that EPAL 2015 will focus on the systemic aspects
  of blended learning or distance learning course design: the systemic appr
 oach is increasingly being recommended for both research (“design-based 
 research”\, “activity theory”\, etc.) and design. Every course\, be 
 it blended\, distance\, or MOOC\, etc.\, is a training system consisting o
 f a combination of elements\, including resources\, learning activities\, 
 tutoring\, verbal interactions\, and evaluation/certification. These eleme
 nts ought to be analysed as interrelated components. Looking beyond indivi
 dual courses to the “meso” or “macro” level (Fichez)\, institution
 al and societal contexts also influence instructional design\, whether at 
 the adult training\, university\, or school levels.\n\nEPAL 2015’s objec
 tive is to investigate these dimensions of distance learning courses\, and
  the institutional and societal contexts in which they operate\, from a sy
 stemic and multi-disciplinary point of view\, bringing together input from
  the fields of educational science\, information science\, applied linguis
 tics\, psychology\, sociology\, and computing.\n\nHence\, the main theme o
 f the fifth EPAL conference will be the components of learning systems\, e
 specially the interrelations between them. Angles from which these compone
 nts may be addressed include:\n\n- Resources: Lecture videos as a resource
  (MOOCs). Resources drawn from the Internet (notably\, the social web as a
  resource). Resources created by learners and then shared. Links between a
 ctivities and resources.\n- Learning activities: Which activities promote 
 fruitful interactions? What are the characteristics of collaborative activ
 ities? What sorts of activities are best suited to massive online courses?
  to blended learning courses? Links between collaboration and tutoring\, c
 ollaboration and interactions\, and activities and evaluation\, etc.\n- Tu
 toring\, guidance: What kind of guidance for what kind of autonomy? How to
  be “present” from a distance? The socio-affective dimension of tutori
 ng. Tutoring by peers. What kind of guidance in blended learning courses? 
 Links between tutoring and activities.\n- Verbal interactions: Can verbal 
 interaction serve as a criterion for evaluating learning? How are interact
 ions distributed in blended learning courses? Should interactions be synch
 ronous or asynchronous\, written or oral? Interactions between peers. \n- 
 Evaluation/certification: How should collaborative work be evaluated? What
  kind of evaluation in MOOCs? How can MOOC course work be evaluated? Peer 
 assessment. Evaluation of methods/courses/systems.\n\nThe official languag
 es of the conference will be English and French.\n\nEPAL conference websit

DESCRIPTION:Corpus Linguistics and its methodologies\, though somewhat neg
 lected area in Pakistan and other countries in South Asia\, are gaining gr
 ounds not only for the investigation of linguistic matters but also for an
  understanding of many social\, economic and political issues in which lan
 guage plays a central role. However\, there still exist neither national c
 orpus of Pakistani English nor corpus of Urdu nor other regional languages
 .\n\nThe Centre for Corpus Research at Birmingham is one of the major corp
 us linguistics centres in the world and International Islamic University I
 slamabad (IIUI) is one of the first universities in Pakistan in which corp
 us linguistics is being developed\, and it is assuming a prominent role in
  promoting the development of research agenda that is focused on issues\, 
 such as the description and analysis of local Englishes.\n\nInternational 
 Islamic University in collaboration with the University of Birmingham is o
 rganizing a “3-day International Corpus Linguistics Workshop” which wi
 ll be held on 9-11 February 2015. All 30 participants (15 from UK and 15 f
 rom Pakistan) will be selected through peer review process and depending o
 n the quality and relevance of their abstracts.\n\nThe workshop is sponsor
 ed by British Council and Higher Education Commission in Pakistan. The wor
 kshop is fully funded including registration fee\, travel allowance\, acco
 mmodation\, workshop material as well as meals during the workshop.\n\nThe
  workshop will provide a forum for early career researchers to exchange ex
 perience\, best practices and ideas related to current and emerging issues
  associated with Corpus Linguistics.\n\nFor detailed conference informatio

DESCRIPTION:It has been almost a century since C. K. Ogden\, a linguist\, 
 and I. A. Richards\, a literary critic\, published the provocatively-title
 d book The Meaning of Meaning\, which set the foundations of modern approa
 ches to the ever-intriguing and elusive phenomenon of meaning. Instead of 
 the simplistic straightforward connection between the sign and the referen
 t\, their famous triangle as the model of meaning was a step forward in re
 lation to de Saussure’s\, by placing more emphasis on the thought\, our 
 mind as the locus of meaning construction and meaning interpretation. This
  widely opened the door for various disciplines which view meaning as some
 thing that does not reside with words but with people.\n\nThis year\, the 
 conference turns to one of the fundamental questions – meaning\, as some
 thing that is actually expressed\, or intended to be expressed\, indicated
  and significant. Following the footsteps of Ogden and Richards and many l
 inguists\, literary critics and philosophers inspired by them\, we invite 
 contributions which will\, from the perspective of literary studies\, vari
 ous linguistic disciplines as well as interdisciplinary approaches with co
 gnitive sciences\, philosophy of language\, and other social sciences\, in
 crease the understanding of how meaning is constructed and (mis) interpret
 ed\, taking into consideration various contextual and cultural factors.\n\
 nConference fee is 30 Euros (also payable in dinars)\, covering organisati
 onal costs\, conference folder\, refreshments during coffee breaks\, buffe
 t lunch on 24th April\, and snacks before the closing of the conference on
  25 April.\n\nConference dinner party (10 Euros) on 24th April 2015 is opt
 ional.

DESCRIPTION:European integration goes back over 62 years including the Eur
 opean Coal and Steel Community. For a long time it remained closed to popu
 lar concern\, and was mainly a matter for the political class and a few pr
 ofessions directly affected such as civil servants\, financial and industr
 ial elites and exporters\, and specialist lawyers. Everything changed when
  the political and economic elites decided to transform the common market\
 , with its famous common agricultural policy\, into an Economic and Moneta
 ry Union. This project and the adoption of a single currency made it neces
 sary to change public attitudes and therefore to undertake an exceptionall
 y far-reaching communication policy to convince as many people as possible
  of the benefits. Even before the signature of the Maastricht Treaty by he
 ads of state and government in December 1991\, Europe lost its public ‘a
 nonymity’\, as new arguments and terminologies arose within public debat
 es and fundamentally different positions were taken up around the meaning 
 and direction of integration: neoliberalism versus social socially redistr
 ibutive policies\; national sovereignty versus supranationalism\; a Europe
  of states versus a Europe of regions\; and left versus right. A strong bi
 polarisation of attitudes emerged in the construction of straightforward c
 hoices for or against European integration either as a principle\, or in t
 he form it had taken since the Single Market of 1985. Even among advocates
  of European integration\, debates have been intense: widening versus deep
 ening\; federalism versus confederalism\; supranational versus intergovern
 mental\; singlespeed versus multi-speed Europe. These debates are older bu
 t have become more urgent as integration has developed. Since 2010\, the p
 ost-Lisbon shift towards new economic governance structures and policies h
 as accentuated the contested nature of European power\, symbolised for exa
 mple by the highly controversial troika\, as economic and social cleavages
  have hardened: rich versus poor\, banks versus the people.\n\nWhere: Univ

DESCRIPTION:Political Discourse: Multidisciplinary Approaches\n\n26-27 Jun
 e 2015\,University College London\nemail: politicaldiscourse2015@gmail.com
 \n\nPolitical discourse has long been the domain of critical linguists on 
 the one hand\, and political scientists on the other. Critical linguists u
 nderstand political discourse primarily as language in the context of poli
 tics\, while political science understands political discourses as ‘big 
 D’ discourse (Gee 2005)\, as systems of knowledge and ideology.\n\nIn th
 e last few decades\, however\, linguists\, translation scholars and politi
 cal scientists have begun to take a more interdisciplinary stance\, combin
 ing both approaches to D/discourse. In political science\, the study of po
 litical speech and rhetoric begins to be seen as essential for scholars of
  politics\, since ‘the political speech is a snapshot of ideology in act
 ion’ (Finlayson\, Martin 2008\, p. 449). At the same time\, linguistic d
 iscourse analysts have begun contextualizing their analysis using politica
 l and social science methods\, and argue that these methods are necessary 
 in order to explain results of linguistic analysis (see for example Harris
 \, Rampton 2014\; Wodak 2014). This has also had an influence on translati
 on studies\, where cooperation with political discourse analysis is percei
 ved as a necessity (e.g. Schäffner 2004).\n\nThis two-day conference will
  explore and debate the diversity of methods used to analyse political dis
 course in order to encourage the conversation between disciplines involved
 . It will discuss the merits and issues of different methodological approa
 ches to discourse and explore which insights discourse analysts can give i
 nto the cultural dependencies of political discourses in a European and gl
 obal context.\n\nKeynote Speakers:\n\nAlan Finlayson (University of East A
 nglia)\nRuth Wodak (Lancaster University)\n\nBoth Keynote addresses are go
 ing to discuss David Cameron’s speech on Britian’s Membership of Europ
 ean Union at Bloomberg on the 23rd January 2013\, addressing methodologica
 l issues in the analysis of political discourse for political scientists a
 nd linguists. Delegates can familiarize themselves with the text online: h

 University of Tours (France)\n26-27 March 2014\n\nThe Young Researchers of

  organising a conference in March on the topic ''Data and Theory'' with gu
 est speaker Tobias Scheer. All young researchers (masters students\, PhD s
 tudents\, young doctors) are welcome to participate.\n\nConference Theme: 
 Data and Theory\n\nThe issue of the nature of linguistic data along with t
 he principles to be used for the constitution of these data has become cen
 tral in recent years\, and this is demonstrated by the development of corp
 us linguistics. However\, the data are often interpreted through the prism
  of a particular theory\, which can lead us to wonder if doing research in
  a given theoretical background might influence the collection and interpr
 etation of the data. Conversely\, can data impose the application of a cer
 tain theory?\n\nThe reflexion which we propose to conduct during this conf
 erence will focus on the relationship between data and theory\, as this re
 lationship is essential to linguistic analysis.\n\nGuest speaker: Tobias S

DESCRIPTION:Following the previous workshops on laughter held in Saarbruec
 ken (2007)\, Berlin (2009)\, and Dublin (2012)\, we have the pleasure to a
 nnounce a forthcoming workshop in Enschede\, the Netherlands in April 2015
 .\n\nNon-verbal vocalisations in human-human and human-machine interaction
 s play important roles in displaying social and affective behaviors and in
  controlling the flow of interaction. Laughter\, sighs\, filled pauses\, a
 nd short utterances such as feedback responses are among some of the non-v
 erbal vocalisations that have been studied previously from various researc
 h fields. However\, much is still unknown about the phonetic or visual cha
 racteristics of non-verbal vocalisations (production/encoding) and their r
 elations to their intentions and perceived meanings (perception/decoding) 
 in interaction.\n\nThe goal of this workshop is to bring together scientis
 ts from diverse research areas and to provide an exchange forum for interd
 isciplinary discussions in order to gain a better understanding of laughte
 r and other non-verbal vocalisations. The workshop will consist of invited
  talks and oral presentations of ongoing research and discussion papers. \
 n\nRegistration:\n\nAttendees are asked to register by sending an email to
  laughterworkshop2015@gmail.com. A registration fee of 50 Euros has to be 
 paid on site (in cash).\n\nVenue:\n\nThe DesignLab at University of Twente

DESCRIPTION:Special Session at PAAMS 15 - 13th International Conference on
  Practical Applications of Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (http://www.paam
 s.net)\nLAFLang focuses on the common space delimited by three main areas:
  machine learning\, agent technologies and formal language theory. The mai
 n goal of the special session is to promote interdisciplinarity among peop
 le working in such disciplines\, boosting the interchange of knowledge and
  viewpoints between specialists. This interdisciplinary research can provi
 de new models that may improve AI technologies.\n\nUnderstanding human lea
 rning well enough to reproduce aspects of that learning behaviour in a com
 puter system is a worthy scientific goal. One of the less understood learn
 ing capacities of humans is their ability to acquire a natural language. I
 n order to better understand natural language acquisition\, research in fo
 rmal models of language learning\, within the field of machine learning\, 
 has received significant attention. The theory of formal language theory i
 s central to the field of machine learning\, since the specific subfield o
 f grammatical inference deals with the process of learning grammars and la
 nguages from data. \n\nThe theory of formal languages was mainly originate
 d from mathematics and generative linguistics as a tool for modelling and 
 investigating syntax of natural languages\, and then it played an importan
 t role in the field of computer science. While the first generation of for
 mal languages was based on rewriting\, a further development in this area 
 has been the idea of several devices collaborating for achieving a common 
 goal. Formal language theory has taken advantage of the idea of formalizin
 g agent architectures where a hard task is distributed among several task-
 specific agents. In fact\, non-standard formal language models have been p
 roposed as grammatical models of agent systems.

DESCRIPTION:Cognitive-linguistic research on metaphor to date has predomin
 antly examined variation with respect to cross-cultural differences in met
 aphorical mappings\, largely focusing on body parts and the conceptualizat
 ion of emotions. While metaphors and their linguistic instantiations can b
 e expected to vary not only cross-linguistically but also within (pluricen
 tric) languages\, language-internal variation along sociolinguistic parame
 ters such as region\, social class\, ethnicity or gender have remained an 
 underresearched topic to date (Kövecses 2005). More recently\, Cognitive 
 Linguistics has seen an increasing interest in socio-cognitive dimensions 
 and socio-variational phenomena of language use in terms of a Cognitive So
 ciolinguistics  (CS) that aims to extend the cognitive paradigm to the reg
 ional and social patterns involved in linguistic symbolisation (Kristianse
 n & Dirven 2008\; Geeraerts\, Kristiansen & Peirsman 2010). CS investigate
 s how language usage in different regional and social groups is characteri
 sed by different conceptualisations and different grammatical and lexical 
 preferences. It has already been fruitfully applied to the study of World 
 Englishes (e.g. Sharifian 2008\; Wolf 2008\; Polzenhagen & Wolf 2010). Ass
 uming that a language (or variety of language) reflects the cultural conte
 xt of its speech community\, this line of research has highlighted the imp
 ortance of cultural background knowledge and underlying cultural conceptua
 lizations for the interpretation of lexical items and fields in L2 varieti
 es of English. Methodologically\, this approach applies and combines the t
 heoretical framework of CS with corpus-linguistic methods to systematicall
 y study the expression of culture in these varieties of English (Wolf 2008
 \, Wolf & Polzenhagen 2009).\n\nKeynote Speaker:\n\nDr. Alexander Onysko\,

 nGrammar and Text: Crossing borders\nLisbon\, 2-4 July 2015\nLinguistics R
 esearch Centre of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa - CLUNL\nFaculty of Soci
 al Sciences and Humanities - Universidade Nova de Lisboa\n\nThe relationsh
 ip between grammar and text/speech can be considered as a convergence spac
 e. It is therefore possible to start from local linguistic phenomena to be
 tter understand the texts/speeches. But it is also conceivable to start fr
 om textual/discursive configurations to better understand the functioning 
 of language from different points of view - semantic\, pragmatic\, morphos
 yntactic\, enunciative - either from a synchronic or diachronic perspectiv
 e. Both routes can be enhanced in a didactic approach.\n\nThe 4th Internat
 ional Conference on Grammar and Text - GRATO 2015 aims to explore this bor
 der crossing\, as explained in the following thematic axes:\n\n1. From tex
 tual/discursive configurations to linguistic forms and constructions\n2. F
 rom linguistic forms and constructions to textual/discursive configuration
 s\n3. Didactic perspectives on Grammar and Text\n\nGiving priority to work
  that fit explicitly in one of these axes\, GRATO 2015 will provide a broa
 d reflection that can already anticipate questions such as the following:\
 n\n- Which theoretical frameworks and methodologies enable the convergence
  between grammar and text/speech?\n- How to think the constitution of corp
 ora when it is intended to address the intersection between grammar and te
 xt/speech?\n- What can a downward analysis that goes from a social to a li
 nguistic level reveal about the functioning of grammar and texts/speeches?
 \n- In what ways may the linguistic and textual/discursive configurations 
 highlight the potentialities of language?\n- What is the relevance of loca
 l grammatical phenomena to the organisation of texts/speeches?\n- To what 
 extent may the grammatical and textual/discursive approaches contribute to
  a better understanding of the praxeological and gnosiological continuum t
 hat characterizes linguistic activity?\n\nLecturers:\n\n- Bert Cornillie\,

DESCRIPTION:Translation in Transition 2015 conference\n\nThe second Transl
 ation in Transition conference takes place on January 29th and 30th at the
  Faculty of Translation Studies of Mainz University on the campus in Germe
 rsheim\, Germany. This conference deals with emerging fields in the transl
 ation world\, brought about by the ongoing digitalisation which changes th
 e way we translate but also facilitates new ways of research in translatio
 n like keystroke logging\, eye-tracking\, or EEG studies. The second Trans
 lation in Transition conference is a continuation of the first Translation
  in Transition conference held in January 2014 in Copenhagen\, Denmark. It
  invites researchers from various fields like corpus linguistics\, psychol
 inguistics or machine translation who want to present novel research with 
 relation to translation and its changing face.\n\nSpecial Track: The role 
 of the translator in a digitalised world\n\nBesides the main track of the 
 conference\, we aim to run a Special Track with the title ³The role of th
 e translator in a digitalised world². This track shall reflect two facts.
  First\, with machine translation taking on a more and more important role
  in translation workflows\, the question comes up what the future profile 
 of translators will be. What will the future core profile of translators b
 e\, beyond proficiency in post-editing? Second\, translation has become ub
 iquitous and more of a crowd phenomenon\, to be witnessed in crowd transla
 tions in open source projects\, wiki projects etc. How does this shape the
  view on translation and the translator? This track invites empirical and 
 theoretical work with relation to these questions.\n\nOliver Čulo\nFachbe

 “(Up)rooted and (Un)moored: Discourses of Belonging in Hispanic\nand Lus

 the often used category of identity is\, to say the least\, unstable\, mal
 leable\, and always dependent on the existence of an Other. In thinking of
  belonging as a set of discourses that mobilizes individuals and groups\, 
 this year we would like to examine and challenge the notions of rootedness
  and mooring in traditional discourses that have dominated the Hispanic an
 d Lusophone worlds. What are some ways in which literature\, culture\, and
  linguistics respond to these discourses? In what ways do the intersecting
  subcategories of identity contribute to (up)rooting and (un)mooring? We i
 nvite papers that broadly tackle this theme.

DESCRIPTION:State of the art\n\nGrammaticalization research has in the las
 t decade highlighted the notion of construction. Hopper & Traugott (2003:1
 ) in their classical definition of grammaticalization point out that that 
 not only words but also constructions\, i.e. sequences of words\, can unde
 rgo grammaticalization. \n\nAs a term referring to a research framework\, 
 “grammaticalization” refers to that part of the study of language chan
 ge that is concerned with such questions as how lexical items and construc
 tions come in certain contexts to serve grammatical functions or how gramm
 atical items develop new grammatical functions.\n\nHimmelmann (2004:31) in
  turn argues that a grammaticalizing element (he speaks of a ‘grammatici
 zing’ element) should not be considered in isolation but rather in its s
 yntagmatic context\, i.e. the construction it occurs in. \n\nStrictly spea
 king\, it is never just the grammaticizing element that undergoes grammati
 cization. Instead\, it is the grammaticizing element in its syntagmatic co
 ntext which is grammaticized. That is\, the unit to which grammaticization
  properly applies are constructions\, not isolated lexical items.\n\nIn th
 e wake of this work\, efforts have been made to more precisely articulate 
 the largely pretheoretical notion of construction in the theoretical frame
 work of construction grammar. The main tenet of construction grammar is th
 at our grammatical knowledge is made up of a taxonomic network of construc
 tions\, i.e. pairings of form of meaning (Goldberg 1995\, Croft 2001\, Hof
 fmann & Trousdale 2013). Moreover\, no one level of grammar is considered 
 autonomous (Fried & Östman 2004).\n\nIntegrating constructionist insights
  into grammaticalization research has led to new findings: \n\n- Semantic 
 bleaching of grammaticalizing elements is paralleled by semantic changes i
 n the construction they are part of (Hilpert 2008\, Colleman & De Clerck 2
 011)\n- Grammaticalization is accompanied by changes in schematicity\, pro
 ductivity\, and compositionality of the entire construction (Trousdale 200
 8\, 2010)\n- The perceived degree of gradualness\, which is accentuated wi
 thin grammaticalization theory\, can be described as small incremental ste
 ps in various dimensions of a construction (Traugott 2008\, Traugott & Tro
 usdale 2010\, 2013)\n- Statistical methods developed in construction gramm
 ar\, such as collostructional analysis\, can be implemented to help suppor
 t\, falsify and/or uncover ongoing grammaticalization (Hilpert 2008\, 2013
 \, Coussé 2014)\n\nConfronting grammaticalization research with the frame
 work of construction grammar also brought up the question how grammaticali
 zation relates to constructional change in general (Noël 2007\, Gisborne 
 & Patten 2011). As such\, grammaticalization research increasingly interac
 ts and converges with the emerging field of diachronic construction gramma
 r (Israel 1996\, Bergs & Diewald 2008\, Fried 2008\, 2013\, Barðdal 2013)
 . This ongoing interaction has recently led to an analysis of grammaticali
 zation and lexicalization in terms of constructionalization (Traugott & Tr
 ousdale 2013). \n\nWorkshop:\n\nThis workshop aims to bring together resea
 rchers working on grammaticalization and construction grammar in one dedic
 ated workshop\, in order to provide a platform for enhanced collaboration 
 between and integration of both frameworks\, in Scandinavia and beyond.\n\

DESCRIPTION:Theory of language and the Debate on Language Origins\n\nThe U
 niversities of Trento (Department of Humanities) and the University Ludwig
  Maximilian of Munich (Istitut für Deutsche Philologie) are pleased to an
 nounce an international workshop on theory of language and language origin
 . It will be held at the Department of Humanities (aula 007) of the Univer
 sity of Trento\, Italy\, from Wednesday to Friday\, 18-20 November 2015.\n
 \nThere will be no conference fee.\n\nIntroduction:\n\nIn the last decades
 \, one of the major trends in language theory has focused on determining w
 hat constitutes the basic properties of the language faculty (FL) zooming 
 in on its core computational mechanism (Merge) and its connections (interf
 aces) to both the Sensorimotor (SM) and the Conceptual-Intentional (CI) sy
 stems. As a first significant result\, the operation Merge has been taken 
 to be the basic\, pervasive mechanism of Universal Grammar ''for arranging
  items (sounds\, words\, word parts\, phrases) into their possible permiss
 ible combinations in a language'' (Berwick et al 2013: 89\, Glossary). As 
 a second result\, a great deal of research has concentrated on the process
  of externalization shedding light on both surprising analogies and patent
  differences by comparison with the vocalization systems of other species 
 (cf. Watanabe 2011\, Berwick 2011\, Schlenker et al 2014\, among others) a
 nd leading to several proposals also from an evolutionary perspective. How
 ever\, the process linking the computational mechanism to the CI-system ha
 s been poorly investigated and both the neuropsychological and the philoso
 phical issues behind the relationship between language (Merge)\, brain\, m
 ind and thought have mostly been neglected.\n\nOn the other hand\, meeting
 s and conferences on language origin and evolution usually prefer to take 
 a very wide interdisciplinary view on the question\, bringing together fie
 lds whose approaches\, results and conclusions rarely give rise to a mutua
 lly beneficial dialogue.\n\nThe workshop's general goal is to contribute t
 o the ongoing debate on language origin\, taking an explicitly linguistic 
 viewpoint.\n\nAim:\n\nThe workshop aims to investigate the models of corre
 lation between the computational mechanism of language and the interfaces 
 with (but not limited to) special focus on the Conceptual-Intentional syst
 em as well as its connection with other cognitive domains like vision\, sp
 atiality and music from an evolutionary perspective. Researchers working o
 n those topics in the areas of Neurolinguistics\, Psycholinguistics\, Hist
 ory of linguistics and Philosophy of Language as well as in Theoretical Li
 nguistics\, who are committed to the question of language origin and evolu
 tion\, are strongly encouraged to submit an abstract.\n\nInvited Speakers:

 for Language and Cognition (SALC V) will take place in Trondheim\, August 
 19–21\, 2015\, and is hosted by The Norwegian University of Science & Te
 chnology (NTNU).\n\nThe conference will be organized by the Scandinavian A
 ssociation for Language and Cognition (SALC)\, and the Language and Cognit
 ion/LAPL research group at the Department of Language and Literature (NTNU
 ).\n\nThe major goal of The Scandinavian Association for Language and Cogn

 and cognition. This involves any type of research in which language is not
  treated in isolation (e.g. as a ''module'')\, but both as based on struct
 ures and processes of general cognition and social cognition\, and as affe
 cting such structures and processes. The association is intended to be a f
 orum for cooperation and exchange of ideas between disciplines\, fields of
  study and theoretical frameworks.\n\nKeynote Speakers:\n\nSeana Coulson\,
  University of California\, San Diego\nKenny Coventry\, University of East
  Anglia\nJeanine Treffers-Daller\, University of Reading\nAdele Goldberg\,
  Princeton University\nCarita Paradis\, Lund University  \n\nThe aim of th
 e SALC Conference is to promote the cross-fertilization of linguistics and
  close fields\, such as psychology\, cognitive science\, the social scienc
 es\, and education. We are aiming at presenting interdisciplinary perspect
 ives from all of these fields and encourage submissions from all research 
 areas addressing the interface between language and cognition.\n\nConferen

SUMMARY:Media Discourse(s): Adaptation\, Resilience and Mobility in Climat

DESCRIPTION:Media Discourse(s):\nAdaptation\, Resilience and Mobility in t
 he Context of Climate-induced Migration\n9-10 April 2015\n\nConvenors:\n\n
 Katherine E. Russo (Università degli Studi di Napoli L’Orientale)\nGiov
 anni Bettini (Lancaster University)\n\nConfirmed Keynote Speaker:\n\nRuth 
 Wodak \n\nWhile there is a substantial body of research on the empirical a
 nd policy aspects of the climate-migration nexus (not least by critical sc
 holars)\, the question of how it is represented in media discourse(s) (Tal
 bot 2007)\, and of the  effects of such representations\, remains somehow 
 underexplored. \n\nThis workshop aims to fill this gap by trying to reach 
 some significant insights on the current representations of climate-relate
 d migration in media discourse(s). Besides providing background and explan
 atory information on events\, media refrains intervene on morale (Anderson
  2010) thereby conditioning the social apprehension and response to climat
 e change\, adaptation\, resilience and mobility. Lexico-grammatical and di
 scursive resources which regulate appraisal\, affect and evaluation may be
  employed explicitly to inscribe and/or implicitly to invoke affects such 
 as worry and fear\, not in order to prevent and prescribe them but to inte
 nsify and diffuse them (Martin and White 2005). Relatedly\, the role of af
 fective factors in fuelling media interventions and shaping their represen
 tations of adaptation\, resilience and mobility should not be underestimat
 ed. The media invest in affect\, which modulates the circulation and distr
 ibution of worry and fear\, not in order to prevent and prescribe them but
  by intensifying\, multiplying\, and saturating the linguistic\, discursiv
 e and cultural communication through which communities and identities come
  in and out of formation. The resulting culture emerges as a defining aspe
 ct of identity and agency\, and as a trigger of new processes of subjectiv
 ation (Crawford 2009). This is of particular relevance for migration\, whi
 ch per definition entails the renegotiation (and contestation) of social a
 s well as spatial borders/boundaries inscribed in and producing subjectivi
 ties (Mezzadra and Neilson 2014). As the Critical Discourse Analysis schol
 ar Ruth Wodak notes\, “‘inclusion/exclusion’ of groups\, people\, na
 tion-states\, migrant groups\, changes due to different criteria of how in
 siders and outsiders are defined in each instance. In this way various top
 ologies\, or group memberships\, are constructed\, which sometimes include
  a certain group\, and sometimes do not\, depending on socio-political and
  situational contexts and interactions” (2008: 56). In drawing lines of 
 exclusion/inclusion that order and govern climate migration\, media and th
 e affect they mobilize play crucial roles\, exercising diverse impacts on 
 community relations and on matters of hospitality and intercultural commun
 ication – crucially\, influencing the ways in which discourses of adapta
 tion\, resilience and mobility emerge as sites of xenophobia/intolerance a
 nd/or cosmopolitical encounter\, connectivity and conviviality.

DESCRIPTION:Formal and experimental pragmatics: methodological issues of a
  nacsent liaison\n(MXPRAG 2015)\n\nBerlin\, Germany\nCentre for General Li
 nguistics (ZAS)\nDate: 1-3 June 2015\n\nAims:\n\nThe idea of the workshop 
 is to provide a forum for the discussion of methodological questions and r
 elated theoretical issues that arise for researchers working at the interf
 ace between formal pragmatic theory and experimental data.\n\nAfter decade
 s of defying broad-coverage formalization\, recent years have seen a surge
  of precise and testable pragmatic theories\, which have substantially adv
 anced our understanding of various types of pragmatic inferences\, includi
 ng scalar implicatures\, ad hoc Quantity implicatures\, M-implicatures\, a
 nd ignorance implicatures\, to name just a few. At least two kinds of appr
 oaches can be distinguished according to the level of abstraction at which
  they operate. Structural approaches are high-level descriptions of pragma
 tic phenomena in terms of general and abstract constraints\, principles or
  rules. These constraints\, principles or rules are often\, but not always
 \, motivated by ideas about optimal conversation (think: Gricean Maxims an
 d its offspring) and often target the interpretation of sentences in a def
 ault context. On the other hand\, interactional approaches try to explain 
 pragmatic phenomena by explicitly representing relevant contextual factors
 \, distinguishing speaker and listener perspectives and interlocutors' pos
 sibly divergent\, partial or approximate beliefs about the aforementioned.
  Structural and interactional approaches should not be perceived as being 
 in opposition\, but rather as synergetic\, with insights from either posit
 ively stimulating the respective other. In this spirit\, this workshop is 
 about general methodological problems of connecting formal pragmatics to e
 mpirical data\, especially data from psycholinguistic experiments. The pro
 blem is brought to the surface clearly by interactional approaches\, but a
 ffects structural approaches too.  A prerequisite for these models to work
  are formally explicit assumptions regarding speaker and listener beliefs 
 about various contextual factors\, including\, e.g.\, action alternatives\
 , interlocutor preferences\, degree of interlocutor cooperativity\, or dif
 ferential interlocutor knowledge. Therefore\, it is vital that empirically
  driven pragmatic modeling be explicit about how these contextually releva
 nt factors are mapped from the experimental setup onto the formal pragmati
 c theory.  \n\nInvited Speakers:\n\nMike Tanenhaus (University of Rocheste

DESCRIPTION:The past decade has seen the increasing use of experimental ap
 proaches to the study of meaning\, motivated both by a desire to confirm a
 nd augment intuition-based data and by the growing availability of accessi
 ble experimental modalities such as Amazon Mechanical Turk. Experimental P
 ragmatics in particular has become a well-established sub-discipline in fo
 rmal linguistics\, as reflected in a foundational collected volume (Novek 
 & Sperber 2006)\, a biannual conference series XPRAG\, a recently conclude
 d European networking program EURO-XPRAG\, and a new German Priority Progr
 am XPRAG.de.  \n\nExperimental methods have also been applied to questions
  of a semantic rather than pragmatic nature\, and have made significant co
 ntributions in a number of domains\, including quantification (Bott & Rado
  2007\; Hackl 2009\; Pietroski et al. 2009)\, number words and modified nu
 merals (Musolino 2004\; Geurts et al. 2010)\, gradability and vagueness  (
 Frazier et al. 2008\; Syrett et al. 2010\; Alxatib & Pelletier 2011\; Ripl
 ey 2011\; McNabb 2012\; Sassoon 2012\; Solt & Gotzner 2012)\, plurality (S
 auerland et al. 2005\; Pearson et al. 2010\; Grimm 2013) and polarity sens
 itivity (Chemla et al. 2011).\n\nNonetheless\, Experimental Semantics has 
 been slower to establish itself as a specialization in its own right. To s
 ome extent this is due to the challenges inherent to research on semantic 
 meaning\, including difficulties in representing meanings non-linguistical
 ly\, in eliciting the necessary subtle judgments from naïve subjects\, an
 d in particular in distinguishing underlying semantic content (literal mea
 ning) from the results of pragmatic inferencing.  Not the least\, however\
 , is the lack of a dedicated forum where findings can be highlighted and w
 here scholars with diverse theoretical interests can share learning relati
 ng particularly to the role of experimentation in formal semantics.\n\nThe
  goal of ExAS is to provide a platform for the presentation of theoretical
 ly relevant experimental research in formal semantics\, as well as for the
  discussion of the benefits and challenges in conducting experiments into 
 semantic questions.  \n\nExAS will take place as part of the 27th European
  Summer School in Logic\, Language and Information (ESSLLI 2015).\n\nInvit

DESCRIPTION:Conference Objective and Themes:\n\nThe key purpose of the con
 ference is to explore and further develop organizational communication fro
 m different perspectives and address opportunities and limitations of the 
 interaction between different social actors in professional contexts.\n\nI
 n an increasingly complex world\, where groups with different interests an
 d expectations are contesting dominant discourses\, the adaptation of orga
 nizational communication constitutes a strategic\, linguistic and communic
 ative challenge. Where previously the primary concern of organizations wou
 ld have been to communicate with a clearly defined and relatively small nu
 mber of stakeholder groups (e.g. customers\, investors\, suppliers and emp
 loyees) about issues that relate to the financial and commercial aspects o
 f the business\, they are now required to address and communicate with a m
 uch more diverse set of stakeholders about matters that involve social and
  environmental change from local as well as global perspectives.\n\nIn par
 t\, this development has arisen from the increasingly global nature of bus
 iness and its concomitant imprint on natural and social environments acros
 s the world. However\, the increased public awareness of the contestabilit
 y of professional and expert knowledge has also led to intensified interac
 tion among professionals and non-professionals\, among other things as a r
 esult of new web based possibilities of making one’s voice heard\, In th
 is environment\, communication becomes less predictable and less controlla
 ble\, requiring that organizations adopt new modes of interaction. As an e
 xample\, in recent years this has included focus on more dialogic forms of
  communication and the recognition of multiple and potentially conflicting
  identities among stakeholder groups.\n\nBy bringing practitioners and res
 earchers together\, the conference provides a forum for the exchange of id
 eas and sharing of interests across the field of organizational communicat
 ion\, highlighting the value of the Humanities to the analysis and solutio
 n of pertinent issues in business and society. The broadness of the confer
 ence theme supports this vision. Conference themes include\, but are not r
 estricted to\, the following:\n\nStakeholder dialogue\nIntercultural inter

 ombinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG\; Ades and Steedman 1982\, Steedman 200
 0\, Baldridge 2003) have been proposed. But the fundamental question of wh
 ether CG constitutes an adequate linguistic theory still seems to be wide 
 open. Moreover\, there are now numerous variants of CG\, both in the TLCG 
 tradition and in CCG (Oehrle 1994\, Jacobson 1999\, Moortgat 2007\, Pollar
 d and Mihalicek 2010\, Morrill et al. 2011\, Barker and Shan 2015\, to nam
 e just a few). Which of these theories constitutes the most adequate versi
 on of an empirical theory of natural language?\n\nLogical\, mathematical\,
  and computational analyses have tended to take precedence over empirical 
 ones in the past 30 years in CG research. These are all important and very
  illuminating\, but at the same time we may now want to pause and reflect 
 on the question of just where we are in terms of empirical adequacy. In th
 is connection\, it is\, we believe\, instructive to remind ourselves that 
 the most profound areas of mathematics\, such as analysis\, are those whic
 h first emerged in the course of investigations into the properties of the
  natural universe by physicists (Boyer 1949). There probably is a similar 
 relation between formal and empirical investigations in our field as well\
 , and we think that the time is ripe to critically scrutinize the empirica
 l consequences of the various formal techniques/frameworks proposed in the
  literature in the past 30 years\, as well as ones that are being develope
 d at this very moment.

DESCRIPTION:Rationale:\n\nMore than 15 years have passed since the late Mi
 riam Shlesinger called upon the Interpreting Studies community to embrace 
 corpus-based methodologies (Shlesinger 1998). Corpus-based methodologies e
 nable researchers to collect empirical data in quantities large enough to 
 make reliable generalizations about interpreter performance (as opposed to
  studies based on anecdotal evidence)\; moreover\, they also make it possi
 ble to analyse relevant phenomena on greater data sets than is usually the
  case when “manual” methodologies are used.\n\nShlesinger predicted th
 at it would take time to compile such interpreting corpora and she has bee
 n proven right. Indeed\, it took 6 years since the publication of her semi
 nal paper to launch the first large-scale interpreting corpus project at t
 he University of Bologna (2004). In 2005 the European Parliament Interpret
 ing Corpus (EPIC) became the first on-line trilingual interpreting corpus 
 available for research and teaching purposes: EPIC will celebrate its 10th
  anniversary in 2015 (Monti et al. 2005). Other projects have followed ove
 r the last few years\, but corpus-based Interpreting Studies has not devel
 oped as widely as would have been desirable\, probably on account of the t
 ime-consuming nature of data collection and transcription. Today\, only a 
 handful of research centres are working on compiling interpreting corpora 
 (Bologna-Forlì\, UNINT-Rome\, Trieste\, Hamburg\, Poznan\, Ghent…) and 
 the data available are still very limited\, compared with the large quanti
 ties of corpus-based data available in linguistics and translation studies
 . \n\nThe workshop will include a general brainstorming session on collabo
 rative projects in the field of Corpus-based Interpreting Studies. \n\nRef

DESCRIPTION:Special Session at IWANN 2015. International Work Conference o
 n Artificial Neural Networks http://iwann.ugr.es/2015/\n\nMotivation and O
 bjectives for the Session:\n\nNatural Computing (NC) is an emerging field 
 in formal language theory\, which is mainly focused on the computing capab
 ilities of formal devices that abstract some natural complex phenomena. Th
 ese bio-inspired models include both\, classic computing devices (such as 
 cellular automata\, Lindenmayer systems\, DNA computing\, evolutionary com
 putation\, Multi-agent systems or artificial neural networks) and the late
 st and most innovative models of computation such as Membrane Computing or
  Networks of Evolutionary Processors.\n\nRegarding Multi-Agent Systems (MA
 S)\, the concept of agent can be found in a range of disciplines as\, for 
 example\, computer networks\, software engineering\, artificial intelligen
 ce\, human-computer interaction\, distributed and concurrent systems\, mob
 ile systems\, telematics\, information retrieval\, etc.\nNC and hence MAS 
 offer strong models for representing complex and dynamic real-world enviro
 nment. We are convinced that a field where those technologies can offer go
 od solutions and alternative frameworks to classic models is the area of p
 rocessing natural and formal languages. This is why we propose a special s
 ession on language(s) applications of MAS and bio-inspired computing devic
 es.\n\nThe aim of this special session is to bring together researchers fr
 om different areas that have in common the use of multi-agent and bio-insp
 ired systems to approach different aspects of natural/formal language. We 
 aim to bring together researchers that are developing models for dealing w
 ith languages in both\, theoretical and applied lines of research.

DESCRIPTION:De nos jours\, la gastronomie est omniprésente\, et a massive
 ment investi l’espace public que ce soit les salons gastronomiques (Egas
 t) et les innombrables cooking shows\, ou bien les médias et tout particu
 lièrement la télévision : les émissions de téléréalité (Top chef e
 tc.)\, voire les séries télévisées (Chefs) jouissent d’un succès é
 norme. Mais les études scientifiques portent surtout sur l’alimentation
  et la cuisine\, et beaucoup moins sur la gastronomie\, et sont en génér
 al le fait des anthropologues et sociologues (C. Lévi-Strauss\, C. Fischl
 er) et des historiens (J.-L. Flandrin\, B. Laurioux\, P. Ory\, P. Rambourg
 ) avec le développement récent des food studies et la création de l’I
 EHCA (Institut européen d’histoire et des cultures de l’alimentation)
  à l’université de Tours.\n\nLe propos de cette journée d’études e
 st donc d’analyser\, dans une approche interdisciplinaire\, le statut\, 
 les caractéristiques et le développement de la gastronomie moderne\, cec
 i dans deux directions complémentaires.\n\nD’une part\, une analyse lin
 guistique de la gastronomie\, encore insuffisamment développée malgré q
 uelques travaux. Il s’agira par exemple d’explorer les domaines suivan
 ts :\n\n- lexique\, terminologie et dénominations (plats\, ingrédients\,
  vins\, recettes etc.)\,\n- dictionnaires et glossaires culinaires\, gastr
 onomiques et des vins\,\n- phénomènes syntaxiques et discursifs dans les
  textes gastronomiques : livres de cuisine\, menus\, critiques\, etc.\,\n-
  expressions et phraséologismes en gastronomie  \n- approches sémiologiq
 ues et linguistiques\, interrelations langue-image.\n- genres de discours 
 gastronomique\, par exemple discours végétarien\, diététique\, discour
 s du « biologique »\,\n- analyse linguistique et socio-linguistique des 
 genres médiatiques récents.\n\nUne deuxième direction de recherches por
 tera sur le food business\, c’est-à-dire les aspects économiques et co
 mmerciaux de la gastronomie moderne. On s’interrogera entre autres sur :
 \n\n- les caractéristiques\, les acteurs et le développement du secteur 
 économique de la gastronomie en Allemagne\, en France\, en Italie\, mais 
 aussi au Royaume-Uni et aux États-Unis\, en particulier sa mondialisation
  croissante\,\n- les relations entre gastronomie et économie du tourisme\
 ,\n- l’innovation en gastronomie\,\n- les aspects relatifs au marketing\
 , à la publicité et à la communication (p. ex. la Nouvelle cuisine fran
 çaise des années 1970\, la cuisine moléculaire\, le slow food etc.). La
  « starisation » et l’irruption à la télévision des grands chefs é
 toilés ainsi que l’explosion du nombre des écoles de cuisine sont éga
 lement des pistes intéressantes\,\n- la gastronomie dans l’édition et 
 la presse : livres de cuisine\, guides gastronomiques etc.\,\n- les sites 
 web sur les vins\, les recettes (Marmiton)\, les accords entre mets et vin
 s etc.\n\nOn accordera une attention particulière à la place des technol
 ogies numériques dans les analyses linguistiques et économiques de la ga
 stronomie\, aussi bien pour les moyens utilisés que pour les domaines abo
 rdés : emploi de corpus électroniques écrits ou oraux\, présence de la
  gastronomie et des restaurants gastronomiques sur Internet (y compris blo
 gs\, chats\, forums)\, dans les réseaux sociaux (Facebook\, Twitter etc.)
  et au moyen des smartphones.\n\nLes propositions portant sur la gastronom
 ie en Allemagne\, France\, Italie\, au Royaume-Uni et aux États-Unis sero
 nt particulièrement prises en compte\, que ce soit dans une perspective m
 onolingue ou bien plurilingue et contrastive.\nLangue de communication : f

DESCRIPTION:The rapport Man - Earth has shaped human life since ancient ti
 mes. In his constant search to understand and control their immediate envi
 ronment\, man has undertaken action and has developed policies to better m
 anage their space and resources. Land and territory are also subject to so
 ciocultural representations along with their actual or mythical features\,
  limitations and boundaries. Human history is conditioned by this rapport 
 that made the earth the habitat upon which man depend for existence.\n\nUn
 der these conditions\, the earth as occupied territory and as natural reso
 urces has been at the heart of conflicts between individuals and communiti
 es: Families\, villages\, tribes\, confederations\, States\, etc.\, or eve
 n between the state and its citizens. These conflicts may even reach outri
 ght expropriation.\n\nLike any society and community\, the Amazigh have th
 eir representations of land and territories which they occupy and which we
 re at the center of complex issues between tribes\, confederations and kin
 gdoms. Tales explaining the mythical origin of the earth and its resources
  exist alongside customary laws designed to streamline the management of n
 atural resources. However\, the advent of the modern nation-state was the 
 basis for violent change and unprecedented conflict between the state and 
 the secular owners of the land\, between two rationalities and two ways of
  managing the land and its resources. \n\nThe colonial period (1912-1956) 
 marked the beginning of this mutation. The policy of ''pacification'' led 
 by the colonial administration was based on the expropriation of the land 
 of the ''indigenous'' through laws and dahirs. The Moroccan independence a
 uthorities have adopted the same laws and the same dahirs by ratifying thi
 s expropriation policy\, by defining the ''Water and Forests'' zones\, and
  by exploitation of affluence and natural resources without considering th
 e people who lived on the land for millennia. This policy\, which broke th
 e historical relationship between man and his land\, has not only exacerba
 ted the conflicts between state institutions and citizens\, but has also r
 aised again the question of the rights and duties of each other.\n\nRecogn
 izing the importance of the land\, territory and natural resources in soci
 o-economic and cultural balances as well as the democratization of society
 \, the Amazigh Cultural Movement has made the right to the land and its re
 sources\, in addition to linguistic\, cultural and socio-economic rights\,
  one of its central concerns. The current national debate on Human Rights\
 , regionalization and local governance is an adequate framework for findin
 g optimal solutions to conflicts opposing state institutions and citizens 
 whose ancestral land was expropriated.\n\nIt is in this perspective that t
 he conference ''Earth\, Territorialization and natural resources'' aims to
  discuss this issue in its multidisciplinary nature:\n\n- Anthropological 
 Component\nLand in the Amazigh mythology.\nLand in the Amazigh literature.
 \nThe evolution of the territory in the perception of the Amazigh.\n- Lega
 l and ecological Component\nAmazigh customary law and land management.\nAm
 azigh customary law and environment preservation.\nMoroccan law and the ri
 ght to the land.\n- Historical Component\nPlace of land in the Amazigh res
 istance\nColonial laws relating to land\n- Political Component (Territoria

DESCRIPTION:Discourse-Pragmatic Variation & Change (DiPVaC) is a biennial 
 international conference series which was devised to further the quantitat
 ive analysis of variation and change at the level of discourse-pragmatics.
  DiPVaC3\, which will be held at the University of Ottawa 4-6 May 2016\, p
 rovides a platform for the presentation of cutting-edge research into vari
 ation and change in the use of items and constructions often referred to a
 s discourse markers or pragmatic particles whose primary functions are int
 erpersonal and textual (e.g.\, well\, like\, you know\, comme\, alors\, do
 ch\, zwar\, diciamo\, dakedo). It also provides a forum for the formation 
 of new international and multidisciplinary research networks exploring the
  theoretical and social importance of quantitative research into discourse
 -pragmatic variation and change. The conference will bring together partic
 ipants from across the world to achieve multiple aims:\n\n- To discuss met
 hodological\, empirical and theoretical advancements in the analysis of va
 riation and change in the use of discourse-pragmatic features\n- To examin
 e the social implications and applications of research into the use of the
 se features\n- To promote the study of discourse-pragmatic variation and c
 hange within and beyond linguistics

SUMMARY:Constructional & Lexical Semantic Approaches to Russian (IV)

DESCRIPTION:Conference Description:\n\nThe meeting will focus on the issue
 s of Russian syntax. Its central theme is the relation between formal prop
 erties of various syntactic constructions in Russian and their semantic\, 
 pragmatic and discourse properties. Participants are encouraged to discuss
  not only regular syntactic patterns\, but also “marginal” types of co
 nstructions.\n\nInquiry into the syntax of Russian has long been associate
 d with the study of semantic and pragmatic properties of syntactic units. 
 Simplifying somewhat\, two types of approaches have emerged in the study o
 f complex syntactic units: “bottom-up” (“lexical semantic approaches
 ”) and “top-down” (“constructional approaches”).\n\nThe lexical 
 semantic approaches take as their starting point combinatorial potential o
 f individual lexemes\; in particular\, the distribution of syntactic patte
 rns is often claimed to reflect subtleties of lexical semantics (cf. the w
 ork by Yuri D. Apresjan and the Moscow Semantic School). According to this
  approach\, semantic and syntactic properties of complex constructions are
  derivable from semantic and combinatorial properties of their component p
 arts.\n\nThe central unit in the constructional approaches is construction
  — a complex form-meaning pairing whose semantic and syntactic features 
 are not predictable from the properties of its component parts. Within “
 Western” linguistic tradition\, this type of approach is typical of vari
 ous kinds of Construction grammars (Ch. Fillmore\, A. Goldberg\, etc.)\; s
 ome studies within Russian traditional syntax are based on similar (though
  usually implicit) theoretical assumptions.\n\nThe conference is not direc
 tly associated with either of these types of approaches. The major prefere
 nce is given to the studies which focus on the analysis of Russian syntact
 ic phenomena in light of their semantic properties and against the backgro
 und of general linguistic mechanisms such as grammaticalizaton and lexical
 ization.\n\nInvited Speakers:\n\n- Yuri D. Apresjan (Russian Language Inst
 itute\, RAS / Institute for Information - Transmission Problems\, RAS\, Mo

DESCRIPTION:The 9th SIGHUM Workshop on Language Technology for Cultural He
 ritage\, Social Sciences\, and Humanities will be held in conjunction with
  ACL-IJCNLP 2015 which will take place in Beijing\, China\, July 30.\n\nTh
 e LaTeCH workshop series aims to provide a forum for researchers who are w
 orking on developing novel information technology for improved information
  access to data from the Humanities\, Social Sciences\, and Cultural Herit
 age. Since the formation of SIGHUM (ACL Special Interest Group on Language
  Technologies for the Socio-Economic Sciences and Humanities)\, the LaTeCH
  workshop is also the venue for the SIGHUM annual research and business me
 eting.\n\nThe workshop is a continuation of LaTeCH 2007 held at ACL\, in P

 012 at EACL\, in Avignon\, France\, LaTeCH 2013 at ACL\, in Sofia\, Bulgar
 ia and LaTeCH 2014 at EACL in Gothenburg\, Sweden.\n\nIn the Humanities\, 
 Social Sciences\, and Cultural Heritage communities there is increasing in
 terest in and demand for NLP methods for semantic annotation\, intelligent
  linking\, discovery\, querying\, cleaning\, and visualization of both pri
 mary and secondary data\, which holds even for collections that are primar
 ily non-textual\, as text is also the pervasive medium used for metadata.\
 n\nThese domains of application entail new challenges for NLP research\, s
 uch as noisy\, non-standard textual or multi-modal input\, historical lang
 uages\, multilingual parts within one document\, lack of digital semantic 
 resources\, or resource-intensive approaches that call for (semi-)automati
 c processing tools and domain adaptation\, or\, as a last resort\, intense
  manual effort. Digital libraries still lack tools for content analysis\; 
 documents are linked mostly through metadata\, and deep semantic annotatio
 n is missing.\n\nFor this reason\, it is of mutual benefit that NLP expert
 s\, data specialists\, and digital humanities researchers working in and a
 cross these domains get involved in the Computational Linguistics communit
 y and present their fundamental or applied research results.

DESCRIPTION:Toute recherche s'intéressant à la poétique de la transcrip
 tion du discours de l'Autre dans la littérature de l'Antiquité à nos jo
 urs impose l'étude du « travail de la citation » (A. Compagnon) comme f
 ondement même de l'écriture\, au travers par exemple des échos de la li
 ttérature homérique et classique dans la littérature grecque post-class
 ique\, de ceux de la littérature antique dans la littérature moderne et/
 ou médiévale. Mais elle engage au moins autant à réfléchir sur la por
 osité des frontières entre le discours citant et le discours de l'Autre 
 qui apparaît à l'analyse des discours rapportés au style direct ou indi
 rect dans un texte littéraire.\n\nLa représentation du discours de l'Aut
 re exemplifie les tensions entre le leurre avec lequel l'imaginaire collec
 tif considère un objet linguistique\, et sa réalité formelle. La désig
 nation de « paroles rapportées » peut masquer\, sous le trompe-l'œil d
 'une fidélité plus ou moins revendiquée\, la réduction inévitable qu'
 opère toute représentation par rapport à la totalité de l'acte d'énon
 ciation représenté. L'autonymie\, et par conséquent le discours direct\
 , sont au cœur de cette tension entre fidélité et facticité.\n\nLa lit
 térature\, comprise au sens large car envisagée de manière diachronique
  et internationale\, semble mettre en scène le discours de l'Autre comme 
 autonome et tout à la fois lui nier son autonomie. Rencontrer fréquemmen
 t dans un récit réel ou fictif les mots de l'Autre\, notamment du barbar
 e\, de l'étranger\, peut donner l'illusion au lecteur d'une progressive f
 amiliarité avec la langue de cet Autre. Rapporter le discours d'autrui\, 
 même au style direct\, n'est-ce pas toujours déjà se l'approprier ? Com
 ment fonctionne cette illusion d'une compréhension intime d'un mot étran
 ger ? N'est-ce pas au prix du sens véritable du mot cité et d'une schém
 atisation de son usage ?\n\nCe colloque se propose de rassembler des cherc
 heurs d'horizons divers afin de projeter des éclairages aussi bien antiqu
 isants\, littéraires\, linguistiques que stylistiques\, en diachronie et 
 en synchronie\, sur cet aspect de l'hétérogénéité énonciative que so
 nt les illusions attachées à l'autonymie dans la représentation du disc
 ours de l'Autre.\n\nLa littérature\, de l'Antiquité à nos jours\, sera 
 le corpus à privilégier pour ce colloque - sa problématique engage la r
 éflexion par exemple\, mais non exclusivement\, autour des récits de voy
 ages et des témoignages\, qu'ils se veuillent historiques ou non. Les rom
 ans\, poèmes\, nouvelles\, ou autres textes\, retenus comme champs d'étu
 de pourront être de langue grecque\, latine\, française et anglaise. Des
  recherches sur des textes de presse pourront être ponctuellement intégr
 ées.

DESCRIPTION:We would like to invite scholars from around the world to part
 icipate in the 4th conference organized by the Working Group on Non-Domina
 nt Varieties of Pluricentric Languages (WGNDV).\nThe conference is devoted
  to the description of pluricentric languages and in particular of non-dom
 inant national varieties of plc. Languages.\n\nThese are the varieties tha
 t are small by the number of their speakers and their symbolic power\, and
  are not the primary norm-setting centres of the language. They may often 
 be falsely attributed the status of a “dialect”\, and have little or n
 o codification of their norms. Typically\, nd-varieties often have to legi
 timate their norms towards the dominant varieties etc.\n\nThe previous con
 ferences of the WGNDV (see www.pluricentriclanguages.org...conferences) ha
 ve shown that non-dominant varieties around the world have many linguistic
  and sociolinguistic features in common. We would therefore like to deepen
  our knowledge and invite scholars from around the world to take part in t
 he conference and give insight into the situation and features of as many 
 nd-varieties and plc. languages as possible.\n\nConference Language(s) and
  Sections:\n\nThe conference languages will be English and German plus the
  languages of the sections for specific languages if there are enough pres
 entations to establish a section. The following sections are envisaged: En
 glish\, French\, German\, Portuguese\, Russian\, Spanish\, a general secti
 on and a language technology section.

DESCRIPTION:The McGill Canadian Conference for Linguistics Undergraduates 
 - McCCLU - will be held on March 13-15\, 2015. It will again be hosted at 
 McGill University\, Montreal\, by the Society of Linguistics Undergraduate
 s of McGill (SLUM). The aim of this conference is to encourage original en
 deavors into the world of research as well as to enrich the present academ
 ic undergraduate community within the field of linguistics. Although McCCL
 U remains a smaller-scale conference\, it gives students from all subfield
 s of linguistics the opportunity to present their theses and to have them 
 reviewed\, often for the first time. Each participant will have 20 minutes
  to present their research\, followed by a 10 minute question period.\n\nM
 cCCLU is a three day conference for undergraduate students in Linguistics 
 across Canada and the United States. Students will present their research 
 to their peers and professionals in the field. Two keynote speakers from t
 he McGill Linguistics department will also discuss their research. Confere
 nce participants and attendees will be invited to social events throughout
  the course of the conference.

DESCRIPTION:Interphonology in English-learning contexts : new perspectives
  from EFL and ESL research.\n\nThis workshop offers to look into various a
 spects of the phonetic and phonological systems developed by learners of E
 nglish in the context of foreign language learning (EFL) and English as a 
 second language (ESL) in various parts of the world. Interphonological phe
 nomena at the segmental and suprasegmental level will be explored in the l
 earners’ phonological repertoires at different stages of their developme
 nt. Variation will be of particular interest in this workshop: inter-speak
 er and intra-speaker variation not only will be examined within the learne
 rs’ developing phonological system but also across English learning situ
 ations\, i.e. in EFL and ESL contexts. One may ask\, for instance: \n\n- D
 o interphonological phenomena surface in the same way and to the same exte
 nt in situations of EFL and ESL? \n- In other words\, are the features dev
 eloped by learners the same whether they are EFL learners or ESL learners?
  If not\, how different are they and which extra-linguistic factors are in
 volved? \n- To what extent is such comparison tenable altogether\, both th
 eoretically and empirically? \n- What is the role of input in contexts whe
 re different varieties of English are spoken?\n\nWhile promoting interdisc
 iplinary research\, this workshop aims at bringing together scholars from 
 a formal linguistic tradition and variationist sociolinguists interested i
 n learner phonology to deepen our understanding of interphonological syste
 ms where variation is also taken to be an integral part of the learning pr
 ocess. We also welcome specialists exploring applied linguistic issues and
  didactics in both EFL and ESL situations to further help investigating le
 arner interphonology in English-learning contexts.

DESCRIPTION:BreMM15: \nSecond International Symposium on the Theory and Pr
 actice of Multimodal Research	\nInterdisciplinary Conference at Bremen Uni
 versity\, Germany\n\nThe second edition of the Bremen multimodality confer
 ence takes differences in national and international perspectives on multi
 modality as a starting point of discussion and analysis and invites furthe
 r inquiry into the specific theories and practices of multimodal research 
 today. By making explicit which aspects of description\, terminology\, and
  methodology vary and which difficulties result from these variations in d
 aily academic life\, it expands the discussion of applicable approaches to
  multimodal document analysis.\n\nMultimodality is one of the most influen
 tial semiotic theories for analyzing media artefacts nowadays\, and it enj
 oys growing popularity globally. However\, this popularity does not imply 
 universality: the empirical application and even the conceptual anchoring 
 of multimodality often remain nationally and regionally grounded. Definiti
 ons of modality and even mediality thus differ from each other in terms of
  their starting points. From a German national perspective\, language rema
 ins the main point of description. International\, mostly Anglo-Saxon appr
 oaches\, in contrast\, no longer take language as the main semiotic resour
 ce of communication but treat it as one more part of the multimodal ensemb
 le carrying meaning. 	\n\nThe second edition of the Bremen multimodality c
 onference takes these differences in national and international perspectiv
 es as a starting point of discussion and analysis. In addition\, whereas o
 utside Germany multimodality is already firmly anchored in BA- and MA-leve
 l courses as well as a highly discussed topic in international conferences
 \, its counterpart in Germany is still situated in a small niche within br
 anches of applied linguistics. The 2014 symposium in Bremen uncovered a la
 rge potential for multimodality’s expansion in the German-speaking conte
 xt\, and the 2015 meeting will keep up with this theme. The multimodal ana
 lysis of documents which are not predominantly anchored in verbal text\, s
 uch as film\, comic books\, or Web material\, offers fruitful ground for i
 nternational exchange and is\, thus\, of particular interest to the 2015 c
 onference.

 Workshop Description:\n\nEven experiments reported in the best journals of
 ten present results that cannot be reproduced\, either because the origina
 l data or software is not available\, or because re-running the presented 
 programs leads to different results. Moreover\, slight changes in the impl
 ementations often (e.g.\, different parameter settings\, dataset size or r
 epresentation) often lead to significantly different results. At the same 
 time\, a number of repositories\, web services or processing pipelines for
  natural language processing (NLP) are being developed\, but\, so far\, wi
 thout a focus on experiment replicability and comparability.  Therefore th
 ere is an urgent need to provide repositories of stable NLP datasets\, as 
 well as mechanisms and platforms for running experiments that would enable
  easy comparison of results. Such platforms\, enabling the sharing of work
 flows\, could provide major benefits for the entire community: for replica
 bility of experiments it should be enough for the authors to provide the d
 atasets\, the URL of the developed workflow and the parameters used.

DESCRIPTION:In recent years\, specialists in language instruction have pai
 d much attention to the contribution of theatrical practices - and\, more 
 broadly speaking\, of artistic practices - to the learning of modern langu
 ages. This symposium intends to look into a body of work that has so far b
 een neglected: artistic practices used as a way to teach Ancient Languages
 \, whether at school\, college\, or in local associations\, in France and 
 abroad.\n\nFor a long time now\, however\, there have been many examples o
 f such practices. The Educational Theatre of Jesuit colleges\, used from t
 he sixteenth century onwards\, is one of the most famous examples. Indeed\
 , this type of practice is remarkable because of its wide audience as well
  as its ‘holistic’ educational approach. Nowadays\, Ancient Language t
 eachers may organize Olympiades\, tiny drama workshops\, unpolished perfor
 mances or even erudite pageants to provide their pupils with a different a
 pproach to Ancient Languages and Cultures. Thanks to the stage\, acting an
 d oracy\, this approach may be more physical and more emotional than those
  they are used to encountering in the classroom\, in terms of what the Com
 mon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) calls “knowledg
 e”\, “skills” and “existential competences” (three macro-categor
 ies that apply to each form of learning).\n\nSo far\, these many and varie
 d practices have not been taken into account in any theoretical analysis o
 r synthesis\; at most\, we are presented with field reports. This symposiu
 m is intended to address this lack of scientific background.

 n\nMarch 25 and 26\, 2015\nOrganized by Willem Zuidema\n\nSpecial theme: T
 he coevolution of biology and culture\n\nNatural language is an extremely 
 complex and varied phenomenon and very different from both other human cog
 nitive functions and animal communication. Yet\, at the level of genes\, b
 rain structures\, anatomy and basic learning procedures the mechanisms sup
 porting language and speech are not so clearly language-specific. How can 
 the conflict between evidence pointing to biological continuity and eviden
 ce for the uniqueness of language be resolved? In this workshop experts fr
 om animal behaviour\, linguistics\, psychology\, human genetics and comput
 ational modelling review evidence from variety of fields about the biologi
 cal and cultural evolution of language and speech. The workshop will end w
 ith a general discussion where we will critically assess the popular theor
 y that coevolution of biology and culture plays a key role in resolving th
 e conflict.\n\nInvited Speakers:\n\nJennifer Culbertson\n(Edinburgh/Johns

DESCRIPTION:Indigenous languages across the world are disappearing at a ra
 pid rate. In some cases\, Indigenous children continue to learn the tradit
 ional Indigenous language as their first language\, while in other communi
 ties new mixed languages\, or creoles are emerging. In many of these situa
 tions\, when children enter the formal education system\, they will encoun
 ter for the first time the dominant language of the country. In some cases
  they may able to attend a bilingual school\, but more usually will enter 
 a school in which education is entirely in the dominant language. In many 
 cases\, the children do not achieve the same level of success as their pee
 rs who speak the national language and are schooled in it.\n\nThis worksho
 p addresses the language practices of Indigenous children aged between 4 a
 nd 12 as they make transitions from home to school\, and as they move from
  home language to mastering the dominant language of the country.

DESCRIPTION:“Phonology of Contemporary English” conference\, to be hel
 d at the University of Toulouse 2 - Jean Jaurès\, Toulouse France\, from 
 9 to 13 April 2015 (Thursday-Monday).\n\nThe prosody of contemporary Engli
 sh: analyses\, interfaces and annotation.\n\nFor this workshop\, the aim o
 f the PAC Prosody group is to gather colleagues working in prosody and/or 
 related fields (discourse\, syntax\, pragmatics\, etc.) in and out of the 
 PAC project. We invite papers dealing in particular with the post-lexical 
 level\, our questionings including the following (non exhaustive) list of 
 issues:\n\n- Intonation contours: phonetic implementation and phonological
  distribution based on meaning in discourse\n- General temporal organisati
 on: tempo\, chunking & prosodic phrasing\n- Context-based sentence stress\
 n- Voice quality\n- Prosodic annotation and tools: parsing at the segmenta
 l level\, modeling of the melodic curve\, representation of prosodic form\
 n\nThe PAC conferences have been organized each year in Toulouse\, Montpel
 lier or Aix-en-Provence since 2004. PAC ''La Phonologie de l’Anglais Con
 temporain: usages\, variétés et structure / The Phonology of Contemporar
 y English: usage\, varieties and structure'' is a programme coordinated by
  Philip Carr\, Jacques Durand and Anne Przewozny. Its main aims have been 
 to provide a better picture of spoken English in its unity and diversity (
 geographical\, social and stylistic)\, to test phonological and phonetic m
 odels from a synchronic and diachronic point of view\, making room for the
  systematic study of variation\, to favour communication between specialis
 ts in speech and in phonological theory\, to provide data and analyses whi
 ch will help improve the teaching of English as a foreign language. We hav
 e been involved in the construction of a corpus of spoken English from 31 
 locations in the English-speaking world. In terms of linguistic study\, th
 e recordings lend themselves to various types of exploitation\, including 
 syntax and pragmatics. The PAC programme has developed into a variety of t
 hematic research groups with dedicated research interests: ICE-IPAC (the
  Interphonology of Contemporary English)\, PAC-Syntax (the syntax\, semant
 ics and pragmatics of contemporary spoken English)\, PAC-Prosody (analysis
  of speech prosody and tools)\, PAC-Research (annotation issues and tools)
 \, PAC-EFL (the teaching of English as a second language and pedagogical t
 ools)\, LVTI (Language\, Urban life\, Work\, Identity) on the study of Eng
 lish in urban contexts. http://www.projet-pac.net

DESCRIPTION:Word-stress in English: empirical and theoretical issues.\n\nO
 rganizers: P. Carr\, J. Durand\, E. Yamada\n\nEnglish word-stress has been
  the focus of a great deal of attention in modern phonology and phonetics.
  The aim of this workshop is to encourage a comparison and confrontation o
 f points of view on this issue. Among the questions to be dealt with are t
 he following (which do not constitute a closed list): \n\n- Is the divisio
 n between lexical and functional categories in dealing with word-stress mo
 tivated? \n- What are its consequences for a theory of word-stress? \n- Wh
 ile there are undoubted generalizations due to morphological structure and
  more controversially syllabic structures\, are these generalizations best
  captured by rules\, constraints or other mechanisms? \n- Can ''parallelis
 m'' and ''serialism'' in the treatment of stress be merged into a single m
 echanism? \n- Is the stress of polysyllabic monomorphemic roots predictabl
 e or entirely lexicalized? \n- How do syllabic structures\, morphological 
 and syntactic information interact in stress generalizations (including co
 mpounds)? \n- Does the splitting of the English lexicon into different str
 ata allow for a better treatment of stress?\n- What is the optimal methodo
 logy for studying lexical stress: dictionaries based on judgements by auth
 ors (constituted as searchable data-bases) or large spoken corpora? \n- If
  the latter\, how does one handle differences due to the prosodic structur
 e of utterances (e.g. nuclear vs. non nuclear stresses)? \n- What can we l
 earn from the acquisition of stress by children and its possible destructu
 ring within various types of aphasia? \n- What do psycholinguistic experim
 ents tell us about stress?\n- How many degrees of stress should be posited
  for English? \n- What are the physiological or acoustic correlates of the
  degrees of stress postulated by most modern accounts of stress?

DESCRIPTION:What do we mean when we refer to context? And what are the rel
 ations between context and discourse? To what extent can we say that conte
 xt exists ‘out there’\, surrounding but separate from discourse? Can w
 e argue that social/political/cultural/historical/etc. situations influenc
 e the structures of text and talk – or\, on the other hand\, is it more 
 accurate to speak of context models\, wherein discourse participants defin
 e the relevant properties of the communicative situation. Should we regard
  inter-textual relations as context? What about co-text? And what of collo
 cation – is critical corpus linguistics the ultimate in contextualised l
 inguistic analysis or a radically decontextualised linguistic analysis? An
 d how does all of this relate to critique? Is CDA/CDS as an emancipatory p
 roject even possible if social structure is reduced to a ‘context model
 ’?\n\nThese and other questions will be the focus of our two-day symposi
 um on Context and Critique.\n\nWe envisage this to be the first in a serie
 s of symposia focusing on developments in theoretical\, analytical and emp
 irical approaches to Critical Discourse Studies. The number of papers will
  be limited as we do not agree with holding parallel sessions: We want the
  symposium to act like a conversation that will help to reflect on and sha
 pe directions within the field. We will\, therefore\, give priority to pap
 ers that address one or more of the following themes and approaches to exa
 mining context and critique:\n\n1. ‘Language’\, ‘Text’\, ‘Contex
 t’\n\n- Theorising text/context\; co-text and intertextuality\; corpora\
 , collocation and keyness\n\n2. Discursive Practices\n\n- Production and r
 eception studies\; entextualisation & ethnographic studies\;  organization
 al discourse studies\; encoding/decoding\; audience interpretations\n\n3. 
 Structures and/or models\n\n- Various levels of context-as-situation (inte
 r alia\, social\, political\, economic\, historical\, cultural)\; power\; 
 ideology\; cognition and context models

DESCRIPTION:Parameters in Diachronic Syntax \n\nOrganisers: Theresa Bibera
 uer & Ian Roberts\n\nThe central idea in generative approaches to diachron
 ic syntax is that change results from children’s reanalysis of their par
 ents’ grammar\, G1: as they have only indirect access to G1\, via its ou
 tput\, their grammar\, G2\, may differ from G1\, causing syntactic changes
  to emerge inter-generationally. The advent of the Principles and Paramete
 rs era in the late 1970s led to the specific expectation in the diachronic
  context that at least some syntactic changes might be parametric\, entail
 ing parameter resetting. From the outset\, however\, the challenges facing
  a parametric approach to syntactic change were apparent. In the current g
 enerative context\, opinion is divided as to the feasibility of a “post-
 GB” parametric approach to the understanding of syntactic variation: on 
 the one hand\, the empirical failures of GB parameters and/or the conceptu
 al reorientation of the Minimalist Program are taken to argue against purs
 uing further parametric work\; on the other\, there is the argument that G
 B parameters should be viewed as “first-pass” parameters\, with empiri
 cal and theoretical advances since the late 1970s and\, particularly\, in 
 the minimalist context\, pointing towards the kinds of modifications that 
 could lead to a genuinely explanatory theory of parametric variation. The 
 purpose of this workshop is to consider whether or not parametric explanat
 ions should be pursued from the perspective of diachronic syntax.

 during the minimalist era\, and our objective here is to bring together es
 tablished and emerging scholars\, working on an unusually wide variety of 
 languages\, to determine whether this is the (accidental) consequence of t
 he uncertainty surrounding the notion of ‘minimalist parameter(s)’ or 
 whether it is in fact symptomatic of genuine incompatibilities between our
  current understanding of diachronic change and the possibilities predicte

DESCRIPTION:Diverse Englishes\, intercultural communication and 'internati

 d since the early days of British colonisation\, and from the late 1970s\,
  research into the English of speakers for whom it is not the mother tongu
 e has grown dramatically. The first to study it were World Englishes schol
 ars\, whose interest was in the different English varieties used within th
 e postcolonial countries. More recently\, English as a Lingua Franca (ELF)
  scholars have been exploring how English is used in intercultural communi
 cation. In my talk I will discuss the differences between these two resear
 ch paradigms\, consider the next logical development\, then turn to a cont
 ext in which ELF as both phenomenon and field of research is particularly 
 prevalent: Higher Education. Focusing on the UK\, I will consider some of 
 the problems and contradictions relating to English language policies and 
 practices (including entry testing) that exist in universities that consid
 er themselves to be international.

DESCRIPTION:The 3rd Symposium on Prominence and Locality in Natural Langua
 ge (SPLNL-3) will be held in Beijing\, China\, March 20-21\, 2015. It is c
 o-organized by Beijing Language and Culture University\, the journal of Co
 ntemporary Linguistics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) an
 d the Key Research Lab of Phonetics and Speech Science of CASS.\n\nMeeting
  Description:\n\nProminence and locality are important principles in the c
 omputational system of natural language\, the interaction of which\, thoug
 h complex and relativized across languages\, may be a reflex of the optima
 l design of language. Locality relations and conditions have long been obs
 erved and studied in the Generative literature. Under the Minimalist persp
 ective\, locality conditions such as the Minimal Link Condition and the Ph
 ase Impenetrability Condition\, derived from the Economy Principle\, play 
 key roles in syntactic derivations. However\, the role of prominence in de
 rivation and interpretation\, though widely observed in different componen
 ts of grammar\, is less appreciated\, especially in the syntactic studies.
  The 1st and 2nd Symposium on Prominence and Locality in Natural Language 
 held in December 22\, 2012 and December 21-22\, 2013 respectively in Beiji
 ng explored the relevant prominence and locality issues that arose at the 
 syntax-semantics interface. The goal of the 3rd Symposium is to further pr
 omote the exploration of the prominence and locality principles of natural
  language\, their interactions\, and the relevant parametric variations.\n

UID:http://linguistlist.org/issues/26/26-329.html
DESCRIPTION:Traditionally\, research in formal semantics has established a
  theoretical distinction between presuppositions and implicatures. This tr
 aditional view is based on the different behaviour of presuppositions and 
 implicatures in embedding environments\, their (non)ability of being cance
 lled\, and the triggering mechanism behind them. Presuppositions\, on the 
 one hand\, are said to be lexically triggered inferences\, which project u
 nder negation and other types of embeddings\, and are non-cancellable. Imp
 licatures\, on the other hand\, are claimed to be triggered by certain lin
 guistic structures only in specific contexts\, to not project and to be ca
 ncellable. This has led to a formal semantic modeling of presuppositions a
 s prerequisites that have to be fulfilled in the context in order for utte
 rances to be felicitously uttered. Implicatures are modeled as inferences 
 which\, in certain contexts\, enrich the assertive meaning of an utterance
 .\n\nThis traditional view has been challenged by recent research on presu
 ppositions and implicatures. This recent research primarily takes into con
 sideration experimental as well as cross-linguistic data. It paints a more
  complicated picture and makes a distinction between both types of inferen
 ces less clear cut.\n\nThe workshop will provide a forum for researchers w
 orking on these two phenomena to discuss their latest insights on the basi
 s of empirical data\, such as experimental and/or crosslinguistic data.\n\

 que touchant aux problématiques posées par les actes de résistance et d
 e résilience dans la littérature francophone migrante au Canada\, probl
 ématiques liées à des thèmes qui occupent aujourd’hui une place impo

 réateur est un moteur fondamental de l’affirmation identitaire qui perm
 et de dire non à l’adversité en maintenant l’espoir de nourrir de no

  suivre séquentiellement de près ou de loin l’acte de résistance pour
  donner vie autrement aux nouvelles aspirations et formes envisagées. La 
 résilience est donc le moteur qui élabore les stratégies de survie et d
 e transformation\, « Un merveilleux malheur » (titre oxymore du livre de
  Boris Cyrulnik)\, qui permettent de surmonter les divers obstacles et de 
 finalement vivre différemment\, « Autrement pareille » pour reprendre l

 ience ferait en sorte que tout échec soit résorbé de manière contrôl

 du discours social et de ses fonctions. La littérature migrante en contex
 tes minoritaires nous permet d’observer diverses stratégies d’écritu

DESCRIPTION:QMM1 will provide a forum for research on quantitative approac
 hes to the description and analysis of morphological phenomena in natural 
 language. The term 'morphology' is construed broadly\, covering all types 
 of form variation. The class of quantitative approaches is equally broad\,
  including (but not limited to):\n\n- Information-theoretic approaches\, d
 iscriminative and Bayesian learning models\,\n- Simulation-based approache
 s\, connectionist models\, vector-based semantic models\, etc.\n\nThe meet
 ing will consist of a two-day conference on quantitative approaches to mor
 phology\, followed by three days of tutorials devoted to topics\, methods 
 and tools relevant to current quantitative models.

DESCRIPTION:Western thought has privileged sight above all other senses\, 
 placing hearing a distant second and touch\, taste and smell among the ‘
 lower senses’. This hierarchy of the senses was accepted even by Simmel\
 , whose belief that ‘senses build a thousand bridges between human being
 s’ forms the basic premise of the ‘sociology of senses’ he single-ha
 ndedly founded. The ocularcentric bias\, pervading modern thought\, has af
 fected semiotics itself\, which proved reluctant to follow up Claude Levi-
 Strauss’s ‘science of the concrete’ and explore the intricate ‘fug
 ue of the five senses’ characterizing the modern sensory regime. The dis
 tinctiveness of the latter was compellingly grasped by Marshall McLuhan wh
 o highlighted the ways electronic media demolish the hegemony of vision by
  fostering a kind of tribal\, multi-sensorial sensibility. Since the 1990s
 \, the ‘lower senses’ have attracted the systematic attention of cultu
 ral history\, sociology\, anthropology and philosophy\, challenging the si
 multaneous rise of the Visual Studies paradigm with their insistence on th
 e need to move beyond the hegemony of vision. \n\nThe conference aims to c
 ontribute to the investigation and understanding of our current shifting s
 ensorium\, by encouraging the examination of the ways contemporary digital
  technologies\, multi-modal texts\, multi-medial and multi-sensorial semio
 sis - in fields as varied as art\, museums\, popular culture\, architectur
 e\, urban life\, learning\, education\, social interaction practices and e
 motional economies both in and out of the internet - disrupt and transform
  the traditional hierarchy of senses. It also seeks to advance our underst
 anding of how this happens through the sweeping revalidation of the hither
 to marginalized senses of touch\, smell and taste\, as well as the prolife
 ration of multi-sensory and synesthetic regimes of communication and exper
 ience.

DESCRIPTION:2015 TINVOM Conference\nThe First International Conference on 
 ''Translation and Interpreting: New Voices on the Marketplace'' (TINVOM)\n
 16-18 April 2015\n\nTranslation and Interpreting Studies have always been 
 at the crossroads of research and practice. Professional practice is both 
 the starting point and the endpoint of the different approaches in this di
 scipline. Higher education curriculums are increasingly required to strike
  a balance between 'learning' and 'earning\,' hence the need for practical
  programs that could help university graduates or trainees enhance their e
 mployability skills. To build operational capacity and provide the profess
 ional skills required by the translation market\, training programs--mainl
 y at the MA level--need to seek fresh insights from theoretical and empiri
 cal research. But how to harness professional practice for more effective 
 training programs? What opportunities are offered new MA graduates to join
  the translation/interpreting labour market?  What coaching/mentoring is n
 ow given (or needs to be given) to new freelancers to help them survive th
 eir first steps in the profession? What is the nature of the role that sea
 soned translators and interpreters need to play in this capacity-building 
 process\, and how to go about it?\n\n The purpose of this conference is to
  bring together researchers\, translator and interpreter trainers\, academ
 ics\, professional translators and interpreters\, recruiting agencies and 
 students to engage in a discussion on the profile of the MA graduate\, the
  current situation of the teaching and practice of translation and interpr
 eting\, the salient features of the marketplace\, the prospects of the ind
 ustry\, the challenges new freelancers (will) face\, the roles of the prof
 essionals\, and the resources and opportunities available.\n\nRegistration
  Deadlines & Conference Fees: \n\nOverseas Participants: \n\nEarly bird (1
 1 March 2015 to 3 April 2015): 60 EUR  (70 TND for local participants)\nGu

DESCRIPTION:The Pacific Rim Conference on English Studies is a graduate-ru
 n conference featuring panels on linguistics\, literature\, rhetoric and c
 omposition\, and some interdisciplinary studies. This year the topic is ab
 out place and the influence of place on language.\n\nKnowing One’s Place
 : Understanding the Influence of Place in Language\nDate: April 1-2\, 2016
 \n\nPlace is both the how and where of what we experience. Our memories ar
 e shaped by liminal moments\, delineating instances in time and space that
  are particularly dominant. Language too\, is influenced by space\, evolvi
 ng to suit our surroundings even as we name those surroundings according t
 o what we value. We use language to inhabit social places even as we navig
 ate physical and metaphysical spaces by using our understanding of the wor
 ld\, an understanding intrinsically shaped by language. It is therefore th
 e personal and universal\, exclusive and inclusive\, physical and imaginat
 ive\, political and educational\, cultural and ideological aspects of lang
 uage and place that we at the University of Alaska Anchorage ask you to ex
 plore with us in this\, our 21st annual Pacific Rim Conference on English 
 Studies.\n\nOrganized by the graduate students within the English departme
 nt\, the Pacific Rim Conference on English Studies invites submissions in 
 literature\, rhetoric and composition\, linguistics\, anthropology\, histo
 ry\, journalism\, gender studies and other related fields. The theme of th
 is year’s conference is “Knowing One’s Place: Understanding the Infl
 uence of Place in Language.” For this conference\, we ask presenters and
  speakers to question how place and space might influence the development 
 of language practices\, how they impact our interactions with one another 
 as individuals and as members of a community\, how physical\, socioeconomi
 c\, gender\, and cultural places impact literature\, how a more globalized
  cultural landscape might be influenced by a convergence of language withi
 n digital spaces\, and how\, historically\, the confluence of languages ha
 ve been viewed within diverse cultural spaces.

DESCRIPTION:The Language and Language Teaching Conference (LLTC) 2015 is o
 rganized by the English Language Education Study Programme of Sanata Dharm
 a University\, Yogyakarta\, Indonesia. \n\nThe main theme of LLTC 2015: ES
 L Teaching in the 21st Century: Its research and Trends\n\nThe widespread 
 use of English has prompted many governments to include English language l
 earning in their core education curricula. Along with this policy is the p
 rogress of the teaching-learning methods ranging from a teacher-centered i
 nstruction to that of focusing on learners and learning. Research in Engli
 sh language teaching has also enjoyed similar advancements attributable in
  part to the contributions of psychology\, sociology and anthropology. The
  current presence of the eclectic method paradigm has enriched and further
 ed our understanding of the traditional quantitative and qualitative resea
 rch paradigms. English language teaching and research have in turn benefit
 ed from the rapid development in information and technology.\n\nDespite th
 e many efforts made by the governments\, schools and English language lear
 ning centers around the globe\, the teaching of English remains a complex 
 undertaking and full of challenges. Teaching is a highly dynamic enterpris
 e that requires ceaseless efforts to make class interactions as relevant a
 s possible. Given many unprecedented challenges due to the vast growth of 
 information technology and policy changes\, it is imperative for teaching 
 practitioners to keep themselves updated. In response to such challenges\,
  the 2015 LLTC held by the English Language Education Study Program of San
 ata Dharma University seeks to create a venue for the exchange of informat
 ion and best practices. The conference\, which coincides with Sanata Dharm
 a University’s 60th anniversary\, proves our commitment to bringing toge
 ther all the diverse best practices in English language teaching and resea
 rch from around the world to a forum of sharing\, collaboration and unders
 tanding. \n

DESCRIPTION:Ce colloque vise principalement à promouvoir l'échange de co

  notamment le changement linguistique\, les enjeux du contact langagier et
  les conséquences de ce contact\, que ce soit d’un point de vue synchro
 nique ou diachronique.\n\nEn littérature\, nous nous orientons plutôt ve
 rs le rapport que l'auteur entretient avec son oeuvre\, où la littératur
 e devient alors lieu de rencontres. Nous nous intéressons à ce qui sort 
 de cet union\, aux rapports de pouvoirs et d’ordre du discours\, à la p
 résence de l’entre-deux\, mais aussi à une esthétique de l’hybridit
 é de la langue.\n\nThe principal aim of this colloquium is to promote the
  exchange of new understandings in the field of contact languages. We seek
  to explore the phenomenon of linguistic contact within the following thre
 e areas: linguistic change\, issues of linguistic contact and the conseque
 nces of contact\, whether\nfrom a synchronic or diachronic perspective. \n
 \nThis colloquium is also oriented towards the role of language contact in
  literary texts\, through the relationship an author has with his or her l
 anguages\, where  literature becomes a linguistic meeting place. We are in
 terested in what results from this contact\, the relationship of authority
  and order in the discourse\, the presence of an in-between\, as well as t
 he aesthetic hybridity of language.

SUMMARY:Information Structure in Spoken Language Corpora 2
DTSTART;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20151202T000000
DTEND;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20151204T000000

DESCRIPTION:The study of information structure (IS) is primarily establish
 ed for well-described languages\, but there is a clear need for new data f
 rom a greater variety of languages (Büring 2009). Indeed\, IS theory has 
 been criticized as being shaped by just a handful of languages (Matić & W
 edgwood 2013). Moreover\, new evidence from lesser-known languages seems t
 o challenge previously established assumptions (Rialland & Robert 2001\, A
 damou & Gordon 2014 among others).\n\nBut the attempt to analyze IS is oft
 en considered a ‘luxury’ in the study of lesser-known or endangered la
 nguages despite its centrality in actual communication. One important reas
 on is that the study of IS is complex and requires the analysis and intera
 ction of several linguistic levels\, involving syntax\, morphology\, and p
 rosody. This implies an excellent understanding of the so-called canonical
  syntactic and prosodic structures of a given language\, which is already 
 an enormous and time-consuming task.\n\nAlso\, IS in major-communication l
 anguages is often analyzed through intuitive judgments\, elicitation\, exp
 erimental tasks\, and rich corpus analyses (Calhoun 2010)\, offering the p
 ossibility of conducting both qualitative and quantitative studies. Howeve
 r\, the implementation of these methods in the context of understudied and
 \, in particular\, endangered languages\, proves to be extremely challengi
 ng. Most linguists working on such languages have no native speaker intuit
 ions\, and speakers often have difficulties with elicitation tasks involvi
 ng metalinguistic awareness. Furthermore\, while the study of spontaneous 
 speech may appear as an alternative to using experimental or elicited data
 \, the existing text corpora of under-documented or endangered languages a
 re relatively limited in size\, often lack explicit question-answer pairs 
 that are needed for the study of focus\, and the context and speakers’ i
 ntentions are difficult to analyze (Schultze-Berndt & Simard 2012). Thus\,
  on one hand the study of IS phenomena in lesser-known languages is crucia
 l for the understanding of IS cross-linguistically\; on the other hand\, i
 t poses a particular challenge because of the difficulty to obtain reliabl
 e data.\n\nThis conference aims at providing an opportunity to discuss the
  above-mentioned methodological problems\, possible solutions\, as well as
  research findings from the study of lesser-known languages in relation to
  their impact on the theory of IS.\n\nInvited Speakers:\n\nSasha Calhoun (

 Gelderen (University of Arizona)\nLisa Green (University of Massachusetts 
 at Amherst)\nTonjes Veenstra (ZAS)\n\nConference website for (free) regist
 ration and further information: www.gre.ac.uk/copulas\n\nCopulas are an ar
 ea of the grammar where languages exhibit large variation. Some languages 
 show no copula whatsoever in some instances\, while other languages have f
 our or five different copular forms. The type of variation is also diverse
 \; in some languages the variation consists of contrasts between inflected
 /non-inflected forms (e.g.\, African American English\, Green 2000)\, and 
 others between different lexical copulas (e.g.\, Spanish\, Arche 2006\, F
 ábregas 2012\; Irish\, Doherty 1996\; Bambara\, Koopman 2003\; Tibetan\, 
 Garrett 2001\; Odia\, Mahapatra 2002\; Saramaccan\, Veenstra 2012). The ru
 les determining variation also differ. In some languages variation depends
  on the tense on the clause (Hebrew\, Rapoport 1987\; Arabic\, Benmamoun 2
 000\; Russian\, Turkish\, Wetzer 1996\, Stassen 1997\, Baker 2003\; or Sak
 ha\, Baker & Vinokurova 2012)\; in others on the predicate type. As for th
 eir morphology\, some copulas are verbal while others are described as pro
 nominal (Rapoport 1991\; van Gelderen 2011)\, and others have prepositions
  at their source (Pustet 2003).\n\nAims of the Workshop: \n\n- To discuss 
 the syntax and semantics of copular variation across languages. What do co
 pulas combine with and what do they mean?\n- To discuss the relation of th
 e copulas to TAME (tense\, aspect\, mood and evidentiality). Why absent in
  some tenses? What are the evidential readings?\n- To discuss the morpholo
 gical incarnation of the copulas: what is involved in the morphology of th
 e copulas and what does it tell us about what a copula is? \n\nIlluminatio
 n for these questions can come from:\n\n1) The description of the morpholo
 gy\, semantics and syntactic distribution of different copulas in differen
 t languages and dialects and different acquisitional stages of languages.\
 n2) The description of the diachronic development of the morphology\, sema
 ntics and syntactic distribution of the copulas in different languages.\n3
 ) Qualitative or quantitative analysis of copula realisation and variation
  using corpus-based methods.

DESCRIPTION:Languages such as Russian\, Modern Greek\, and Lithuanian have
  lexical accent\, according to which the single surface accentual peak (or
  ictus) results from the accentual properties of its constituent morphemes
  and the prosodic phonology of the language (Revithiadou 1999\, 2001). As 
 this definition itself makes clear\, the factors that determine the surfac
 e distribu- tion of the ictus are complex. While the archaic Indo-European
  languages (Sanskrit and Ancient Greek above all) support the reconstructi
 on of lexical accent for the proto-language\, the nature of this system\, 
 and its relation to morphophonological vowel alternations (ablaut)\, have 
 been a central occupation of Indo-European linguistics for well over a cen
 tury (e.g. Hirt 1895\, 1900\, Pedersen 1926\, Kuiper 1942\, Schindler 1972
 a\, 1972b\, Eichner 1973\, Schindler 1975). In recent years\, moreover\, i
 ncreasing attention has been paid to the question of how the insights of t
 his research program can be reconciled with advances in the application of
  morphophonological theory to lexical accent systems (Kiparsky 2010\, Kü
 mmel 2014\, Kiparsky forthcoming\, with further literature below).\n\nGive
 n these complexities\, it is thus not surprising that over time\, lexical 
 systems are often replaced by systems in which the ictus is determined sol
 ely by prosodic structure. Such a change took place in Germanic\, for inst
 ance\, as it replaced the older system of lexical accentuation known from 
 Sanskrit and Ancient Greek with word-initial ictus. The Italic languages i
 nherited a lexical accent system (Vine 2012)\, and then underwent a simila
 r fate\, first shifting to word-initial ictus\, which in turn was replaced
  in Latin by the antepenulti- mate rule (Mester 1994). Loss is not a given
 \, however\, as Russian still maintains a lexical accent system (although 
 it has undergone changes from its postulated Proto-Indo-European ancestor)
 . Interestingly\, we can in some case witness changes-in-progress\, for in
 stance within Sanskrit\, we can observe certain lexical items within infle
 ctional classes following a newer prosodically-determined accentuation in 
 contrast to the older system of lexical accentuation\n(Lundquist 2014).\n\
 nThis workshop aims to investigate diachronic prosodic change within lexic
 al accent systems —to explore how and why the accentual properties of in
 dividual morphemes change and what factors contribute to the diachronic (i
 n)stability of lexical accent.\n\nThe full workshop description can be fou

  English Language Learner.  As emergent bilingual Americans\, developing t
 he potential of these students is a national priority.  Focused solely on 
 English\, instruction for emergent bilinguals often disregards their full 
 linguistic capacities.  This symposium examines how dynamic bilingualism a
 s the practice of engaging students’ bilingual language skills to advanc
 e learning in English.\n \nThe Literacy and Multilingual Studies Departmen
 t of Mercy College in collaboration with the New York State Association fo
 r Bilingual Education (NYSABE) invite you to join the dialogue on using bi
 lingualism as a resource for academic achievement. \n\nA provocative keyno
 te address and a panel of educators will explore strategies\, successes\, 
 and possibilities.  The audience will be invited to ask questions and shar

 heme of this year’s conference is Critical CALL\, fostering the notion t
 hat we now want to step back and critically appraise the field of CALL\, t
 o unpack and examine some of the assumptions that may have become ingraine
 d in our practice\, and also to reflect on the state of CALL and language 
 pedagogy. There is also a need to take a critical stance and question what
  it is we are doing and whose interests we might be serving\, since techno
 logy is not neutral\, and nor is education. Inspired by those who advocate
  critical approaches to second language teaching\, learning and assessment
 \, especially when mediated by technology\, we are particularly interested
  in contributions that look at the interdependence between language learni
 ng\, power relationships and social change.\n\nKeynote Speakers:\n\nKeynot

 org.\n\nThe International Society for the Study of Time\nSixteenth Trienni
 al Conference\nTime¦s Urgency\n26 June to 2 July 2016\, University of Edi
 nburgh\, Scotland UK\n\nThe Edinburgh conference will mark the 50th annive
 rsary of the ISST and of the publication of the seminal volume The Voices 
 of Time\, in which ISST Founder J. T. Fraser assembled perspectives on tim
 e by experts across the disciplines. Time has arguably become an even more
  pressing subject over the ensuing five decades across and within many fie
 lds. This event thus presents an especially apt occasion to present discip
 linary perspectives on time and debate potential relations among them. Fra
 ser's synthetic vision\, built on a fundamental distinction between time f
 elt and time understood\, found expression in his integrated\, hierarchica
 l theory of time. The ISST is interested in exploring the extent to which 
 Fraser's philosophy continues to provide a means to integrate disparate di
 sciplinary perspectives on time\, in the wake of increasing specialization
  and the emergence of new practices\, experiences\, and concepts of time. 
 Time's urgency is felt and understood on several scales and from many pers
 pectives. On the individual and social levels\, the increased speed of com
 munication has created a global now and expanded the horizon of the electr
 onic present. It has also increased the pace of work and economic exchange
 \, the management of global conflicts\, and the volatility of markets and 
 political systems. All this has encouraged a shrinking of temporal horizon
 s with respect to the past and the future\, and a pervasive feeling of tem
 poral stress among societies and individuals. Human history\, by contrast\
 , is increasingly understood and imagined in relation to vast terrestrial 
 and cosmic timescales. Geologists\, ecologists\, historians and critical t
 heorists debate issues around the Anthropocene\, a proposed geological age
  defined by humanity¦s becoming a force of planetary change. The Anthropo
 cene marks a break with progressivist views of classical modernity\, as a 
 cascade of irreversible alterations in climate and biodiversity seems to c
 all for ever more rapid human response and repair. Climate change\, politi
 cal and economic upheaval\, and dystopian futures are explored in film\, l
 iterature\, art and philosophy. Corporations\, states and scientists striv
 e to envision and realize technotopias that would increase control (by who
 m\, for what purpose?) over human biology\, society and the environment. A
 ll these divergent perspectives involve the issue of time's urgency. The I
 SST seeks to engage in a robust interdisciplinary exploration of Time's Ur
 gency and invites participation from scholars in the humanities\, social a
 nd natural sciences\, as well as artists working in any media.

 2 April 2015 in Pappenheim (Altmühl valley). Based on last conference’s
  discussions\, the frame topic for the conference will be: Building Euroli
 nguistics as a Solid Subject. The conference is open to basic research\, a
 pplied research and interdisciplinary research. \n\nFurthermore\, particip
 ants plan to write a brief memorandum aiming to establish Eurolinguistics 
 as a constant subject at universities and schools. Due to the positive exp
 eriences at the 2013 and 2014 conferences\, there will also be a section i
 n which experts and laypersons discuss with each other. It is the EHP’s 
 aim that not only the academic\, but also the general public becomes more 
 aware of Eurolinguistic work. A preliminary program is available at the EH
 P website at http://www.ehp-online.eu or http://ehp.pappenheim.de/en/resea

SUMMARY:2nd Workshop on on Argumentation Mining

DESCRIPTION:The goal of this workshop is to provide a follow-on forum to l
 ast year's very successful Argumentation Mining workshop at ACL\, the firs
 t research forum devoted to argumentation mining in all domains of discour
 se.\n\nArgumentation mining is a relatively new challenge in corpus-based 
 discourse analysis that involves automatically identifying argumentative s
 tructures within a document\, e.g.\, the premises\, conclusion\, and argum
 entation scheme of each argument\, as well as argument-subargument and arg
 ument-counterargument relationships between pairs of arguments in the docu
 ment. To date\, researchers have investigated methods for argumentation mi
 ning of legal documents (Mochales and Moens 2011\; Bach et al. 2013\; Ashl
 ey and Walker 2013\; Wyner et al. 2010)\, on-line debates (Cabrio and Vill
 ata 2012)\, product reviews (Villalba and Saint-Dizier 2012\; Wyner et al.
  2012)\, user comments on proposed regulations (Park and Cardie 2014)\, ne
 wspaper articles and court cases (Feng and Hirst 2011). A related older st
 rand of research (that uses the term 'argumentative structure' in a relate
 d but different sense than ours) has investigated automatically classifyin
 g the sentences of a scientific article's abstract or full text in terms o
 f their contribution of new knowledge to a field (e.g.\, Liakata et al. 20
 12\, Teufel 2010\, Mizuta et al. 2005). In addition\, argumentation mining
  has ties to sentiment analysis (e.g.\, Somasundaran and Wiebe 2010). To d
 ate there are few corpora with annotations for  rgumentation mining resear
 ch (Reed et al. 2008) although corpora with annotations for argument sub-c
 omponents have recently become available (e.g.\, Park and Cardie 2014).  \
 n\nProposed applications of argumentation mining include improving informa
 tion retrieval and information extraction as well as end-user visualizatio
 n and summarization of arguments. Textual sources of interest include not 
 only the formal writing of legal text\, but also a variety of informal gen
 res such as microtext\, spoken meeting transcripts\, product reviews and u
 ser comments. In instructional contexts where argumentation is a pedagogic
 ally important tool for conveying and assessing students' command of cours
 e material\, the written and diagrammed arguments of students (and the map
 pings between them) are educational data that can be mined for purposes of
  assessment and instruction (see e.g.\, Ong\, Litman and Brusilovsky 2014)
 . This is especially important given the wide-spread adoption of computer-
 supported peer review\, computerized essay grading\, and large-scale onlin
 e courses and MOOCs.\n\nSuccess in argumentation mining will require inter
 disciplinary approaches informed by natural language processing technology
 \, theories of semantics\, pragmatics and discourse\, knowledge of discour
 se of domains such as law and science\, artificial intelligence\, argument
 ation theory\, and computational models of argumentation. In addition\, it
  will require the creation and annotation of high-quality corpora of argum
 entation from different types of sources in different domains.

 n\, Humanities Institute\, Belfield\, Dublin 4\, Ireland\nOrganizers: Bett
 ina Migge\, Máire Ni Chiosáin\, Noel Ó Murchadha\n\nModern sociolinguis
 tic research on the Celtic languages represents a diverse constellation of
  research agendas that complement earlier pioneering dialectological studi
 es. These modern approaches diversify the field of Celtic sociolinguistics
  and enhance our understanding of the current dynamics of the Celtic langu
 ages in their social environments by deconstructing the nexus between the 
 individual\, the linguistic\, the social\, and the cultural. Such research
  plays a vital role in elucidating the nature of both language and society
  in late modernity where social arrangements and linguistic practices are 
 increasingly fluid and changeable.\n\nThe aim of this symposium is to prov
 ide an opportunity for postgraduate research students and early career res
 earchers to present their work and to bring these researchers together wit
 h established academics working on the sociolinguistics of the Celtic lang
 uages. The meeting will feature scholars who approach research on the Celt
 ic languages from varying theoretical perspectives and who adopt diverse t
 heoretical and methodological approaches. It will therefore provide an ins
 ight into current approaches to Celtic language sociolinguistics and will 
 allow for constructive discussions on possible future directions in the fi
 eld as society adapts to changing social and linguistic circumstances.\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Lexical Plurals are plural forms (oats\, remains) in which plu
 rality constitutes an inherent lexical specification (cf. Booij 1994\, 199
 6 : ''inherent inflection''\; Acquaviva 2008). As such\, they cannot be ac
 counted for by means of a grammatical rule (or generalization) yielding no
 uns that mean 'many x' as opposed to the meaning of the corresponding sing
 ular form 'one x'. Therefore they have to be learned as part of ''what it 
 is to know a word''.\n\nThis wide-ranging definition aims at covering a ve
 ry large spectrum of phenomena that have been dealt with from quite a numb
 er of different points of view\, which are reflected in the abundant termi
 nology found in this domain (pluralia tantum\, plural mass\, greater plura
 l\, pluriel interne\, …). None of these approaches fully cover the whole
  issue of ''lexical plurals''.\n\nMost of these phenomena have too often b
 een relegated to the heading of (archaic) ''language curiosities''. Howeve
 r\, since a couple of years\, especially since Paolo Acquaviva's 2008 mono
 graph (Lexical plurals\, Oxford Univ. Press)\, they have been put to the f
 ore. Moreover\, it appeared that\, cross-linguistically\, these lexical pl
 urals constitute a quite stable language phenomenon (Corbett 2000 8-10 \; 
 Acquaviva 2008: 109)\, although within each language they appear as idiosy
 ncrasies\, whose numeric importance should not\, however\, be underestimat
 ed. \n\nThis two-day workshop aims at bringing together linguists (and psy
 cholinguists)\, coming from diverse theoretical and methodological horizon
 s\, covering the whole linguistic spectrum\, from formally oriented work t
 o work inspired by cognitive or functional approaches\, presenting both de
 scriptive and theoretical work (generalizations/proposals of modeling)\, s
 ynchronic and diachronic\, dealing with one particular language system or 
 implying several languages.\n\nThe following colleagues have already accep

 aviva (University College Dublin)\nWiltrud Mihatsch (University of Bochum)

DESCRIPTION:Part of ESSLLI 2015\nTYTLES: TYpe Theory and LExical Semantics
 \nBarcelona\, August 3-7 2015\n\n(Robin Cooper\, University of Gothenburg 
  & Christian Retoré\, LIRMM & université de Montpellier) \n\nThe pioneer
 ing work of Ranta (1994) on using Type Theory for NL semantics has initiat
 ed a strong interest in the use of Type Theories for representing formal s
 emantics. And even though Type Theory was initially mainly concerned with 
 compositional and formal semantics\, a number of linguists\, logicians and
  computer scientists noticed the relevance of type theory for lexical sema
 ntics as well. Around 2000 the paper “the metaphysics of words in contex
 t” by Asher & Pustejovsky (2001) initiated Type Theoretic approaches to 
 lexical coercions and meaning transfers by investigating extension and ref
 inement of the type system used by Montague. Accounts for this type of phe
 nomena need to capture ordinary selectional restriction phenomena (e.g. a 
 “chair” may not “bark”\, in an ordinary context)\, while at the so
 me time they have to ensure some flexibility for adapting meanings to cont
 exts in case of meaning transfers\, co-predication etc. The study of this 
 kind of phenomena is of course not new. Their study goes back at least til
 l the 80’s (Bierwisch\, Nunberg\, Cruse among others). What is relativel
 y new is the study of these phenomena from the perspective of Type Theory 
 and this approach is by now quite successful as valuable and recent type t
 heoretical contributions on incorporating lexical considerations into comp
 ositional semantics show (Asher\, Bassac\, Chatzikyriakidis\, Cooper\, Luo

 lication aussi bien synchroniques que diachroniques qui en découlent : tr
 aduction\, comparaison des fonctionnements morphologiques et syntaxiques d
 es langues\, analyse des diversifications des familles de langues ou des d
 iversifications à l’intérieur d’une même famille\, étude des matri
 ces et des motivations du signe dans des langues apparentées ou non\, rap
 ports entre langues des signes et langues orales. Garnier (1985)\, qui rep
 rend le terme «systématique comparée » de Goodall et Joly (1965)\, rap
 pelle le postulat psychomécanique du caractère systématique des paradig
 mes grammaticaux\, qui implique que les choix grammaticaux opérés dans l
 a production d’un texte sont conditionnés par le « systèmes de systè
 mes » qu’est la langue. Ceci permet une comparaison entre différentes 
 langues qui ne soit pas faite à la pièce\, mais qui repose sur des princ
 ipes cohérents. La reconnaissance du plan de la puissance permet aussi de
  compléter l’approche énonciative (e.g. Guillemin-Flesher 1981)\, qui 
 se penche avec application sur les opérations énonciatives ayant lieu da
 ns le passage de la langue au discours\, mais sans guère accorder d’att
 ention aux conditions mêmes permettant la réalisation de ces opérations
 \, qui résident dans la langue. La distinction entre le plan de la puissa
 nce et le plan de l’effet semble également d’une importance capitale 
 pour la théorie de la traduction\, dont la pratique vise à produire le m
 ême effet que celui créé par un texte original en utilisant les potenti
 alités expressives d’une autre langue. Chevalier et Delport (1995) mett
 ent toutefois en garde contre une pratique de la traduction qui ne viserai
 t à conserver que les effets pragmatiques sur le récepteur dans la langu
 e d’arrivée\, en faisant abstraction de la cause première responsable 
 des effets produits sur le récepteur dans la langue de départ\, et qui n
 ’est nul autre que le texte original. Les problématiques dans ce domain
 e sont donc nombreuses et délicates\, ce qui devrait donner lieu à une g
 rande variété de contributions et à des discussions animées.

DESCRIPTION:7th International Conference of Hispanic Linguistics \n5th Bie
 nnial Meeting of the International Association for the Study of Spanish in
  Society [SIS-EES]\n\nOver recent decades\, linguistic and sociolinguistic
  research has been transformed by an increasing focus on the social\, cult
 ural and linguistic changes brought about by globalisation\, increased mob
 ility\, transnational flows\, new technologies and a changing political an
 d economic landscape. These changes have had major implications for the wa
 ys in which we conceptualise the relationship between language and society
  in the twenty-first century. A new communicative order has emerged in whi
 ch we find new types of speakers\, new forms of language and new modes of 
 communication. The conference theme addresses the challenges and opportuni
 ties that this new communicative order presents to researchers working wit
 h Spanish and situations of Spanish in contact in the twenty-first century
 . In addition to papers related to the conference theme\, we also welcome 
 any other submissions that are related to Spanish in Society.

SUMMARY:Language Diversity in the Sinophone World: Policies\, Effects\, an

DESCRIPTION:Language diversity is a ubiquitous feature in the sinophone wo
 rld. In the past and present\, language planning agencies in the area comm
 only – if not uncontroversially – referred to as ''Greater China'' hav
 e responded differently to the challenges of multilingualism. After severa
 l decades of national language policy\, Mandarin is now widely used and br
 oadly accepted in Mainland China\, Singapore\, and Taiwan. It is used to a
  much lesser degree in Hong Kong and Macao\, where Cantonese\, the major r
 egional language\, arguably enjoys a higher prestige than other so‐calle
 d ''dialects'' elsewhere. At the same time\, there are notable differences
  with regard to international language planning – most important\, the i
 ncorporation of English into school curricula and/or the acceptance of Eng
 lish as an official language.\n\nOne purpose of the symposium is to bring 
 together scholars who are working on language planning and official respon
 ses to language diversity. Another purpose is to compare the effects of la
 nguage planning and the manifestations of language diversity in the daily 
 lives of the speakers. Lastly\, we aim at situating the conference theme i
 n a historical context. The reason behind this historical contextualizatio
 n is to find out to what extent language-related phenomena are imbedded in
  Chinese traditions\, and to what extent they can be accounted for by anal
 ytical approaches that are not bound to Chinese culture and/or history. To
 pics include language contact phenomena (e.g.\, code mixing)\, multilingua
 lism in classrooms\, language variation and language use in the media\, an
 d nonofficial language ideologies and activities of language revivalist gr
 oups.\n\nPapers will be presented by invited speakers only. Everyone inter
 ested in attending the conference should contact the organizers before 22 
 May.

DESCRIPTION:Faculty of Arts (LASU) and African Studies Institute (UGA)\n1s
 t Joint International Conference\n\nTheme: The Humanities and the Indigeno
 us Knowledge System (IKS) in Africa and Africa’s Diasporas\n\nGlobal aca
 demic attention is being given to research based on the concept of Indigen
 ous Knowledge System\, IKS. Quite a handful of scholars have insisted on t
 he need to for current research attempt to be pivoted on methodologies tha
 t are solely based on IKS. This insistence has led to the evolution of ver
 ve academic and\, in some cases\, journalistic arguments in favour of the 
 reliance on the indigenous knowledge and provisions in its system for the 
 purpose of solving humanity’s problems that modern science has failed to
  solve. This proposition and attitude to knowledge and its application to 
 solving human problems has also brought into limelight the need to investi
 gate further the strength of Indigenous Knowledge System supporting resear
 ch in the humanities. The quest is against the background that what consti
 tutes the Humanities is still an on-going debate. In addition to that\, ge
 ographical spaces where the Humanities ought to consider as frontiers of k
 nowledge generation\, transmission and application are also areas of the e
 xtent IKS must be studied.\n\nNumerous questions clamour for answers. Thes
 e questions range from definition\, conceptualisation\, application and th
 eorising of problems within the frame of approaches to academic research p
 ivoted on IKS. The humanities as conjectured here include mental\, behavio
 ural and geographical spaces identified with Africa and its Diasporas. Adv
 ocates of the IKS as the source of energy for initiating and sustaining re
 search in the humanities have constantly viewed Africa as a domain for exp
 loring vast resources of indigenous knowledge in many areas of human inter
 est. These areas include but not limited to research in science\, social s
 cience\, arts\, law\, anthropology and history. Religion and philosophy of
  African societies have also been   relied upon for the development of res
 earch methodologies and theories in creating solutions to problems of huma
 nity.\n\nThe Faculty of Arts\, Lagos State University\, Ojo\, Lagos\, Nige
 ria in collaboration with the African Studies Institute\, University of Ge
 orgia\, Athens\, Georgia\, USA has organised an International Conference o
 n the theme\, “The Humanities and the Indigenous Knowledge System (IKS) 
 in Africa and Africa’s Diasporas”. The aim of the conference is to cre
 ate the enabling academic platform for researchers in all disciplines in t
 he Humanities to ventilate fresh ideas and discuss issues on the theme of 
 the conference. The hope is that hazy views on the importance and signific
 ance of IKS to researching Africa and its Diasporas will be thoroughly dis
 cussed and conclusions will be reached on contentious matters. Such matter
 s include issues of methodology and IKS\, knowledge discovery\, identifica
 tion\, application and dissemination and IKS\, responding to actions and r
 eactions from the point of view of the influences of IKS on research.\n\nD

 nsmitted via satellite. \n\nThis conference aims to contribute to our unde
 rstanding of the human capacity for language\, understood as a generative 
 procedure that relates sounds and meanings via syntax. While theoretical h
 ypotheses about this relation are part of the generative enterprise since 
 its beginnings\, recent developments address the issue in terms of the pro
 perties of the 'language organ'. Different hypotheses about the properties
  of the generative procedure\, giving rise to the discrete infinity of lan
 guage\, are under discussion\, and their connection with biology is open t
 o important cross-disciplinary work. Advances have been made in human-anim
 al studies to differentiate human language from animal communication. Cont
 ributions from neurosciences also point to the exclusive properties of the
  human brain for language. Studies in genetically based language impairmen
 ts also contribute to the understanding of the properties of the language 
 organ.\n\nInvited speaker: Ken Wexler\, MIT

DESCRIPTION:The workshop is part of the 38th Annual Conference of the Germ
 an Linguistic Society (DGfS) to be held in Konstanz\, Germany\, February 2
 4—26\, 2016. For further information see http://dgfs2016.uni-konstanz.de
 /\n\nThe workshop “Empirical Methods and Grammatical Theory: The Issue o
 f Gradience”\, organized by Tom Juzek (Oxford University) and Jana Häus
 sler (University of Potsdam)\, will take place February 24—26\, 2016.\n\
 nIn recent years\, issues surrounding the empirical basis of linguistic th
 eory have been discussed intensively again and again (e.g. in a special is
 sue of Theoretical Linguistics\, 33 (3)\, 2007 and a special section in Ze
 itschrift für Sprachwissenschaft\, 28 (1)\, 2009). The workshop aims to b
 ring together different views on the relationship between empirical method
 s and grammatical theory with a focus on issues of gradience. Traditionall
 y\, grammatical theory is based on categorical (i.e. binary) distinctions\
 , and introspective judgments\, i.e. judgments provided by the linguist he
 rself\, constitute the primary method to obtain data. Empirical studies\, 
 on the other hand\, recurrently yield gradient patterns. This discrepancy 
 raises questions like the following which are potential topics for the wor
 kshop.\n\n- Is gradience an experimental artefact or do we have to account
  for it?\n- If the latter: Is gradience a performance-effect\, which shoul
 d be reduced\, or is it part of the grammar and should be modelled?\n- Can
  categorial models and gradience be reconciled with each other?\n- Can gra
 dience be found on all levels of the grammar and if so\, does it have the 
 same relevance on each level?\n- Are introspective judgements by linguists
  indispensable\, as they might be less vulnerable to confounding factors\,
  or they are too unreliable and should be backed up by empirical data?\n- 
 How can the impact of possible confounding factors be estimated and reduce
 d?

 April\, 2016\nLodz\, Poland\n\nLodz International Studies Academy\n\nToday
  to an even larger extent than in the past centuries\, communication frequ
 ently takes place between individuals and institutions representing differ
 ent national and cultural backgrounds. This has resulted in a vast body of
  theoretical discussions on the relation between language\, culture and di
 scourse\, as well as in the emergence of empirical research on intercultur
 al encounters.\n\nIn reference to the works of Professor J.K. Chambers (20
 03)\, Canada is perhaps the most multilingual in the world not only in the
  obvious sense that countless languages are spoken there but also in the s
 ense that those language groups tend to sustain themselves beyond the seco
 nd generation. The country may perhaps be considered multicultural in the 
 sense that it does not have a distinct culture\, yet it is made up of diff
 erent cultures that people bring with them when they come to Canada. Does 
 Bissoondath’s (1994) claim that multiculturalism limits the freedom of m
 inority members\, by confining them to cultural and geographic ghettos sti
 ll prove valid? Does Stoffman’s (2002) critique of the policy of Canadia
 n multiculturalism feel reasonable? Does multiculturalism threaten to redu
 ce the Quebec culture to just another ethnic group? \n\nFees and Payment:\

 . It is being organized in honour of Elizabeth Cowper\, in the wake of her
  retirement in June 2014. \n\nThe workshop aims to investigate the role of
  contrast in syntactic theory\, particularly the representation of syntact
 ic features. Much of Elizabeth’s research has focused on the nature of g
 rammatical features\, both in identifying the set of features active in a 
 particular language or stage of a language\, and in arguing that propertie
 s of different languages may fall out from differences in the set of oppos
 itions they employ.\n\nThe workshop will feature invited talks by 14 of El

 holars working in the fields of Multimodality and Gesture from different p
 erspectives: Pragmatics\, Semantics\, Discourse Analysis\, Semiotics\, Com
 putational Linguistics\, Gesture Studies\, Cognitive Science\, Computer Sc
 ience\, etc.\n\nThe language of the workshop will be English. There is no 
 registration fee. Financial aid is available (see Submissions and financia
 l aid).\n\nSince the late 1980s\, and with authors such as Kress & van Lee
 uwen\, McNeill or Kendon\, several disciplines interested in discourse\, c
 ognition and the construction of communicative meaning have stressed the i
 mportance of going beyond the verbal dimension of texts\, systematically s
 tudying the interaction of words with other means of communication (images
  and other visual components of discourse\, sound\, gesture\, and proxemic
 s in spontaneous interaction). Multimodality studies have become increasin
 gly important for the study of the human mind\, influencing views of cogni
 tion as integrative\, embodied\, extended\, embedded\, enactive\, distribu
 ted\, etc.\n\nTo deal with the full complexity of multimodal communication
  and its interplay with cognition\, new methods and tools are needed. The 
 Red Hen Lab is a recent international initiative for developing a large au
 diovisual dataset (the NewsScape Library of Television News Broadcasts) an
 d a multidisciplinary community for the study of big data from multimodal 
 communication. This workshop seeks to expand and consolidate our group of 
 cooperative researchers. \n\nThe MMM Workshop is interested in exploring a
 nd promoting interdisciplinary methods to approach gesture and multimodal 
 instances of discourse. The following issues may be of particular interest
 : \n\n- Multimodal models of cognition\n- Multimodal Pragmatics\n- Multimo
 dal Discourse Analysis\n- Gesture\, speech and meaning construction in spo
 ntaneous interaction\n- Corpus approaches to gesture\n- Computational tool
 s for multimodal datasets\n- Digital Humanities resources for multimodal d
 atasets\n\nWorkshop Structure:\n\nThe workshop will seek fruitful interact
 ion between participants at all times\, combining talks by the invited spe
 akers with demonstrations of Red Hen resources\, roundtable discussions\, 
 and generous time for Q&A and debate. There will also be a blitz presentat
 ion session (10-minute talks) followed by a poster session\, where blitz t
 alks will be presented as posters\, with ample time for further interactio
 n with workshop participants.

DESCRIPTION:Interdisciplinary colloquium\nConstructing the self: \nLinguis
 tic and historical perspectives on identity and authenticity\nSat. 25 Apri
 l 2015 — Paleis der Academiën\, Brussels\n\nHistorians and linguists al
 ike share an interest in the everyday writings of ‘common people’. Wit
 hin the field of social history\, approaches from below and Alltagsgeschic
 hte came to the foreground since the 1980s\, while within linguistics\, th
 e shift from a ‘bird’s eye’ to a ‘worm’s eye’ perspective has 
 taken place in more recent years within the discipline of historical socio
 linguistics. On the heuristic level\, both disciplines share an interest i
 n similar types of primary sources\, such as egodocuments. On the analytic
 al level\, both disciplines can also complement each other in terms of the
 ir specific areas of expertise. Historical perspectives may provide lingui
 sts with contextual insights into the language users they are studying: Wh
 o are the common people whose writing they examine\, and what do we know a
 bout their everyday professional and private life\, their schooling\, and 
 so on. Linguistic perspectives may in turn inform social historians about 
 the linguistic and communicative repertoire at these writers’ disposal: 
 How did they speak and write\, how may this have influenced their daily ex
 periences\, and what can we learn about their social background from their
  language use?\n\nBuilding on these shared interests\, this colloquium int
 ends to bring together experts working on perspectives ‘from below’ in
  history and linguistics\, stimulating scholars from both disciplines to e
 xplore common research agendas and possibilities for multidisciplinary app
 roaches from below.\n\nPreceding the colloquium\, the Vrije Universiteit B
 russel will host two master classes on historical and linguistic perspecti
 ves ‘from below’ (Friday 24 April 2015). These interactive seminars wi
 ll be taught by Martyn Lyons\, Emeritus Professor of History & European St
 udies and a leading expert on the writing culture of ordinary people\, and
  Stephan Elspaß\, University Professor for Germanic Linguistics and a lea

 tes.google.com/site/computingnewsstorylines2015/home\n\nScope and Topics:\
 n\nThe First Worskop on Computing News Storylines (CNewS 2015) aims at bri
 nging together researchers and scientists working on narrative extraction 
 and representation from news within Computational Linguistics and Artifici
 al Intelligence. Narratives are at the heart of information sharing. Ever 
 since people began to share their experiences\, they have connected them t
 o form narratives. Modern day news reports still reflect this narrative st
 ructure\, but they have proven difficult for automatic tools to summarise\
 , structure\, or connect to other reports. Most text processing tools focu
 s on extracting relatively simple structures from the local lexical enviro
 nment\, and concentrate on the document as a unit or on even smaller units
  such as sentences or phrases\, rather than cross-document connections esp
 ecially published over longer periods of time. However\, current informati
 on needs demand a move towards multidimensional and distributed representa
 tions which take into account the connections between all relevant element
 s involved in a “story”. The workshop aims at assessing the state-of-t
 he-art in event extraction and linking\, as well as detecting and ranking 
 narratives according to salience. The workshop invites work on all aspects
  of generating narrative structures or components thereof from news. This 
 includes topics such as (but not limited to):\n\n- Detecting events from n
 ews\n- Linguistic expression of relevant events\n- Filtering relevant even
 ts\n- Cumulation of information from news streams\n- Detecting opinions an
 d perspectives\n- Finding trending or serendipitous stories in news\n- Tra
 cing perspective change through time\n- Modeling plot structures\n- Storyl
 ine stability and completeness\n- Annotating storylines\n- Temporal or cau
 sal ordering of events\n- Linguistics resources for storylines\n- Big data

 ontext of an ever changing and dynamic societal\, political\, and cultural
  landscape globally\, and in the UK-context.\n\nThe significance of the ti
 tle ‘The Politics of Teaching and Learning Languages’ is twofold: firs
 t\, it alludes to politics and foreign languages in education\, and second
 \, to the politics of teaching and learning languages. The first of these 
 approaches focuses on political and historical developments that influence
  tendencies\, and shape policy\, in the area of foreign language learning 
 and education. The second approach centres on the ideologically-governed a
 ttitudes that underlie language professionals’\, teachers’\, and textb
 ook writers’ decisions when choosing a particular variety of a language\
 , a particular methodological approach and resources in their teaching\, w
 riting\, and syllabus-design practice.\n\nThe conference programme include

DESCRIPTION:The field of Digital Humanities (DH) combines methodologies fr
 om traditional humanities disciplines (such as history\, philosophy\, ling
 uistics\, literature\, art\, archaeology\, music\, and cultural studies) a
 nd social sciences with tools provided by digital publishing and computing
  (such as data visualization\, audio-visual indexing\, information retriev
 al\, data mining\, statistics\, etc.). It is of increasing interest for th
 e speech technology community: Firstly\, this domain has a high demand for
  speech technology and applications. There are several areas in the Digita
 l Humanities that involve huge amounts of audio-visual data sources (e.g. 
 oral history\, archives of special historical fields\, endangered language
 s\, etc.). Speech technology can help to get a better access to these data
  and to extract relevant information. This should allow scientists in the 
 Digital Humanities to generate and answer new research questions.  Secondl
 y\, audio-visual data sets pose new research challenges for speech and aud
 io researchers: Often the recordings of Digital Humanities scenarios are s
 mall\, fragmented and of limited quality. Little established linguistic kn
 owledge is usually available. Further\, the speech is often natural and sp
 ontaneous. Therefore\, new and better speech processing techniques are req
 uired.\n \nHence\, this workshop is designed to draw the attention of the 
 speech technology community to the field of Digital Humanities and to conn
 ect researchers within and (in the past) tangential to this domain.\n\nOrg

SUMMARY:SLE Workshop on Complex Adpositions in European Languages

DESCRIPTION:This Workshop will be dedicated to a reflexion on the emergenc
 e\, status and definition of Complex Adpositions in European languages (se
 e CfP for further details)\, as part of the 2016 SLE conference in Naples 
 (August 31 to September 3\, 2016).\n\nIn the studies on grammaticalization
 \, the need is felt for a deeper understanding of the processes that lead 
 to the emergence of complex adpositions\, as well as to their evolution an
 d eventual change into simple adpositions and into case markers. The main 
 aim of the present workshop is to look for new insights into these problem
 s in the domain of European languages. The background for these studies ha
 s been laid out in interesting work relating to complex prepositions and/o
 r their grammaticalization\, on the one hand (Lindqvist 1994\, Schwenter &
  Traugott 1995\, Di Meola 2000\, Cifuentes Honrubia 2003\, Hoffmann 2005\,
  among others)\, and to adpositions on the other (as\, e.g.\, Kurzon & Adl
 er 2008\, Hagège 2010\, Libert 2013). We aim at widening the object under
  analysis to complex adpositions\, thus gaining the advantage of contempla
 ting studies on complex postpositions (and circumpositions)\, which have b
 een so far neglected\, at least in what concerns their grammaticalization.

SUMMARY:Ad Hoc Categories and Their Linguistic Construction
DTSTART;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20160831T000000
DTEND;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20160903T000000
UID:http://linguistlist.org/issues/26/26-4540.html
DESCRIPTION:A large bulk of psycholinguistic research (Barsalou 1983\, Smi
 th & Samuelson 1997\, among many others) has shown that the traditional vi
 ew of categories as fundamentally stable objects is untenable in various r
 espects. Categories\, instead\, as Croft & Cruse (2004: 92) put it\, “ar
 e inherently variable\, and created on-line as and when needed”.\n\nLang
 uages have overt strategies that make the online construction of categorie
 s “visible” and explicitly allow the hearer to identify some relevant 
 exemplars as the starting point for an abstraction process leading to the 
 on-line construction of a contextually relevant category. \n\nThese strate
 gies include things as diverse as:\n\n(i) So-called list constructions or 
 general extenders (e.g. Engl. “central Iowa and stuff” as a strategy t
 o construct on-line the ad-hoc category “Rural Areas of the USA”)\, \n
 (ii) Associative or similative plural constructions (cf. (1) see Moravcsik
  2003)\, by which speakers may extend the reference of a given noun to inc
 lude some individual or entities typically associated with the referent of
  that noun\, \n(iii) Derivational collective morphology (cf. (2))\, which 
 can be used productively to create new lexical labels for ad hoc categorie
 s\, \n(iv) So-called representative (Haspelmath 2007) or non-exhaustive co
 nnectives (cf.(3))\, i.e. connectives that specifically encode that the tw
 o (or more) items that they connect are just members of a category includi
 ng other similar elements\, \n(v) Reduplication (cf. (4))\, which in some 
 may be used with such a function\, etc.\n\nThe on-line construction of cat
 egories is thus much more pervasive in grammar than one might assume\, inv
 olving such diverse grammatical domains as number and plurality\, lexical 
 derivation\, connectives and more transparent constructions such as genera
 l extenders. All these construction types share a common function but diff
 er as to the way the category is abstracted away from the given exemplars.
 \n\nThis workshop aims to provide a unified approach to these construction
 s and to their common abstracting function\, by gathering together studies
  that explicitly deal with the strategies that languages use to construct 
 ad hoc categories on-line. We welcome cross-linguistic studies\, taking in
 to account more than one language\, as well as studies dealing with the di
 achrony of these constructions and with their patterning in discourse and 
 interaction\, based on corpus data. \n\nSee examples in the file (see URL)
 .\n\nTopics:\n\nPossible phenomena to be investigated include:\n\n- Exempl
 ifying constructions (meaning ‘for instance’\, ‘such as’\, etc.)\n
 - General extenders\n- Connectives and their exemplifying functions\n- Ass
 ociative and similative plurals\n- Nonce compounds\n- Reduplication leadin
 g to a ‘X and so on’ reading \n- Collectives and their relation to the
  construction of categories\n- Derivational strategies leading to contextu
 ally dependent categories or sets\n- …\n\nPossible topics include:\n\n- 
 Cross-linguistic studies on constructions used to build ad hoc categories\
 n- Diachronic studies \n- Corpus-based research on the referential continu
 ity of the exemplars and the category\n- Analyses of the discourse relevan
 ce and discourse phenomenology of ad hoc categories\n- The cooperation of 
 speaker and hearer in the construction of ad hoc categories in interaction
 \n- Psycholinguistic evidence for how these constructions are processed an

 at the University of Alicante (Spain) on November 20-21\, 2015.\n\nVideo g
 ames have progressively gained a large presence in society. In relation to
  this\, new forms of synchronous telecommunication have emerged\, and term
 s and expressions have made their way into commonplace language. It is aga
 inst this background that the IV International Seminar on English and ESP 
 Lexicology and Lexicography will focus on basically the different lexical 
 and syntactic characteristics of video games that have an impact on langua
 ge and communication.\n\nPlenary Speakers:\n\nAstrid Ensslin (University o

DESCRIPTION:This year Ubiquitous Pen Society (ubipen.org)\, an academic co
 mmunity under the Department of English\, Faculty of Humanities at Chiang 
 Mai University\, Thailand\, will host an international conference (AWC2015
 )\,at Shangri-La Hotel in the heart of Chiang Mai city\, from December 2 t
 o 4\, 2015\, to promote English creative writing and interdisciplinary stu
 dies as well as creativity development.\n\nIn Asian Countries\, English is
  seen very much as the language of business\, not as the language of expre
 ssing their ideas in creative writing piece. Therefore\, creative writing 
 skill is a challenge for most non-native speakers of English to master as 
 it not only becomes an arduous task when they need to begin their creative
  writing piece but the writing process is also more complicated\, involvin
 g a series of forward and backward movements between the writer’s ideas 
 and the manner of expressing thoughts\; both require a high level of their
  language control as well as creativity.\n\nHowever\, while many recent st
 udies report a number of non-native English students are reluctant to writ
 e\, or could not ‘tie' their ideas together into a coherent piece\, the 
 major trends in teaching writing in EFL/ESL classroom only require the lea
 rners to memorise English grammatical rules and grammar-focused writing le
 ssons\, leaving very little room for creative writing and the learner’s 
 creativity. AWC then aims to provide information that can advance the theo
 ry and practice of creative writing pedagogy in second or foreign language
  environment. It is innovative in spanning across all levels of education\
 , from K12 through doctoral level and in revealing similarities and differ
 ences in the practices and concerns regarding English creative writing stu
 dies and pedagogies across different contexts and education systems.\n\nFo
 r more information\, please check our website: ubipen.org\n\n*Due to overw
 helming response to our call and more co-host institutions\, we are moving
  to a larger venue\, to Shangri-la Hotel\, and are also updating some info
 rmation on our website\, including the active board members of 2015 confer
 ence\, updates of keynote speakers and social events. All information\, to
  be ready in April 2015.\n\nFind us also on Facebook page (Find ''English

SUMMARY:Does Phonology Have Heads?

DESCRIPTION:Does phonology have heads?\nConvenors: Geoff Schwartz\, UAM Po
 znan & Shanti Ulfsbjorninn\, University College London\n\nDescriptions of 
 both syntactic and phonological structure frequently make reference to the
  term head to characterize the relationship between two or more features c
 ontained in a single linguistic domain - the head is always the 'more impo
 rtant' of the two entities. In syntax\, this relationship appears to be re
 latively straightforward. \n\nIn phonology\, on the other hand\, defining 
 'headedness'\, if it even exists\, is not so easy. One problem it is not c
 lear exactly which phonological entities may serve as 'heads'. Some theori
 es refer to obligatory items like vocalic nuclei\, yet this definition may
  run afoul of phonetic and functional principles.  Consonants clearly play
  a greater functional role than vowels in the formation of lexical contras
 ts\, as anyone who has ever sent an abbreviated text message\, or studied 
 Semitic morphology\, can attest. In Element Theory\, it is common to claim
  that headedness is a fundamental principle of segmental representations\,
  yet it is not clear how this relates to larger constituents. Metrical the
 ory is another area in which the notion of the head may carry some meaning
 .

DESCRIPTION:“Affectedness” is concerned with the way and the degree in
  which an object changes as a result of the action described by the verb. 
 Sensitivity to affectedness is detected in many typologically distinct lan
 guages (e.g. Sino-Tibetan\, Austronesian\, Japanese\, Papuan\, and Indo-Eu
 ropean\, etc.) and manifested in different ways including but not limited 
 to lexical differentiation\, case marking\, verbal inflection\, voice syst
 em as well as various grammatical constructions. \n\nAffectedness Workshop
  2015 invites abstracts on the following themes: (i) The manifestation of 
 affectedness in natural languages (ii) The nature of the scale in the meas
 urement of affectedness (a universal scale? Multiple scales?) (iii) Classi
 fication of verbs with respect to affectedness effects\, rigidity of such 
 classification and the possibility of shifting between classes (e.g.\, by 
 morpho-syntactic marking).\n\nAffectedness Workshop 2015 is part of the pr
 ogram of the 22nd International Conference on HPSG. The HPSG conference is
  the major conference for research on unification-based grammars\, and bri
 ngs in a wide range of linguistics working on not just syntax\, but also s
 emantics\, pragmatics and typology.   This collaboration aims to bring a w
 ider audience to the issue of affectedness and gain insight of the phenome
 non across various sub-fields. \n\nFor more information\, please check: \n

DESCRIPTION:The last decade or so has seen a rapid growth in the research 
 and development in the field of Natural Language Processing and Computatio

 r languages like Hindi/Urdu and Bangla\, we already have some language res
 ources and some important tools. Larger systems\, such as for Machine Tran
 slation\, have also been developed and deployed in the last decade for maj
 or Indian languages.\n\nHowever\, India (or South Asia) has a large number
  of langauges\, some of them not officially recognised\, even if spoken by
  a large population. Keeping this in mind\, the NLP Association of India h
 ad taken a decision to hold events similar to ICON\, but focused more on l
 anguages of specific regions of India\, including the 'minor' languages. r
 egICON-2015 is the next in this series after the recently held iDravidian-
 2014\, which was co-located with ICON-2014. The focus in regICON-2015 is o
 n the languages of the eastern region of India commonly known as Poorvanch
 al\, as well as some surrounding areas. The symposium will still be open t
 o work on Hindi/Urdu\, English and Sanskrit and will also include Nepali.

DESCRIPTION:How to make things happen in the grammar: the implementation o
 f obligatoriness\n\nDate: September 22\, 2015\, in Tbilisi\, Georgia\nHeld
  as part of TbiLLC 2015: Eleventh International Tbilisi Symposium\non Lang
 uage\, Logic and Computation\n\nInvited Speakers:\n\nOmer Preminger [Unive
 rsity of Maryland\, College Park\, USA]\nIvy Sichel [Hebrew University of 
 Jerusalem\, Israel]\n\nWorkshop Proposal:\n\nWe can distinguish between tw
 o kinds of obligatoriness in grammar: unconditional obligatoriness and con
 ditional obligatoriness. An example of the former is the EPP in English (
 ‘you must’)\, the requirement that all finite clauses have a specifier
 . An example of the latter is the fact that in leista varieties of Spanish
 \, animate objects must be realized as datives unless the grammar blocks d
 ative objects\; in that case\, animate objects may be accusative (‘if yo
 u can\, you must’) (Ormazabal & Romero 2007). These examples are drawn f
 rom syntax but parallel cases are found in the semantics literature. Chier
 chia’s 2013 analysis of Negative Polarity Items requires unconditional e
 xhaustification. On the other hand\, we find that while controlled PRO in 
 the complement of an attitude verb must be interpreted as `de se’\, no s
 uch restriction applies elsewhere.\n\nUnconditional obligatoriness is easy
  to implement in the grammar. Within minimalist syntax\, a common way to d
 o so is by using a feature or an element that forces the presence of some 
 other operator/operation e.g. the encoding of the exhaustification require
 ment on NPIs in Chierchia 2013\, or movement of an XP e.g. encodings of th
 e EPP restriction. If the associated operation does not take place\, the t
 ructure is ungrammatical. Implementing conditional obligatoriness is more 
 complex. One way to think about conditional obligatoriness is in terms of 
 optimization i.e. a certain condition must be satisfied unless it conflict
 s with another condition which it is even more important to satisfy. An in
 teresting alternative developed in recent work by Preminger 2014 involves 
 putting the conditional part of the requirement in the structural descript
 ion of the operation and making the operation itself be obligatory. If the
  conditions for applying the operation do not hold\, the operation does no
 t take place. But the failure of the operation does not however lead to un
 grammaticality.\n\nThe question that we would like to explore is whether a
  unified treatment of obligatoriness is possible in the grammar. There are
  a number of possibilities here. It could be that we need both kinds of ob
 ligatoriness. But a more fascinating possibility is that the kind of oblig
 atoriness we find might correlate with the part of grammar we are dealing 
 with. We are interested in talks that explore obligatoriness in grammar an
 d its implementation. What processes are obligatory and what kind of oblig
 atoriness do we have? And does the mechanism for enforcing obligatoriness 
 correlate with the part of the grammar that we are operating in? Finally w
 here does optionality in grammar fit with our treatments of obligatoriness
 ?\n\nOrganizers:\n\nRajesh Bhatt & Vincent Homer [University of Massachuse

DESCRIPTION:Whereas tone has played a central role in the evolution of pho
 nological theory (Goldsmith 1976\, Pulleyblank 1986\, Yip 2002)\, the chan
 nels by which morphology and syntax trigger tonal reflexes or conversely r
 estrict tonal alternations are still hardly understood. Firmly persuaded b
 y Hyman's (2011) dictum that `tone can do everything segmental or metrical
  phonology can do' (and more)\, we think that it is absolutely essential f
 or linguistics to develop a better understanding for the empirical richnes
 s and the theoretical implications of the morphosyntax of tone. The goal o
 f this workshop is to provide a forum to this end which brings together de
 scriptively and theoretically oriented linguists addressing questions such
  as:\n\n- How does morphosyntactic structure interact with tonal phonology
 ? Do syntactic constructions trigger specific tone patterns? Which types o
 f morphosyntactic boundaries restrict (or are required by) general tonal a
 lternations? Does opacity in tonal processes correlate with morphological 
 and syntactic levels of derivation?\n\n- How does tonal featural affixatio
 n work morphologically? how are tonal morphemes linearized? Where do they 
 show systematic patterns of syncretism and blocking or multiple exponence?
  What is the distribution of tonal prefixation and suffixation? Is there a
  tonal equivalent to infixation\, and how does tonal overwriting work in c
 ontrast to additive tonal morphology?\n\n- What can tonal phenomena teach 
 us about the morphology-syntax interface? Are tonal alternations at the ph
 rasal level substantially different from word-level processes? Where do to
 nal alternations crosscut the boundaries between word-level morphology and
  phrasal syntax?\n\nInvited Speakers:\n\nYuni Kim (University of Mancheste

 at we can approach creativity as a bootstrapping cognitive process in whic

 those that shape the poet. For the purposes of this conference the explora
 tion of the idea of cognitive innovation concerns an understanding of crea
 tivity that is not exclusively concerned with conscious human thought and 
 action but also as intrinsic to our cognitive development. As a consequenc

 nProf. Mabel Rice\, University of Kansas\nProf. Naama Friedmann\, Tel Aviv
  University\n\nThis conference aims to contribute to our understanding of 
 language development in individuals diagnosed with a language disorder (ac
 quired or genetic). Acquired disorders like aphasia may cause severe cogni
 tive and linguistic restrictions. Most genetic disorders have been reporte
 d to result in severe intellectual impairment. The study of the grammar of
  individuals diagnosed with genetic disorders such as Down Syndrome\, Will
 iams Syndrome\, Autism\, and others has the potential of helping to answer
  the guiding question: To what extent does intellectual impairment make it
  impossible to develop grammar? It is often assumed that due to cognitive 
 restrictions the linguistic system is also affected. A number of studies\,
  however\, provide evidence that intellectual challenges do not necessaril
 y prevent the development of language (e.g.\, Bellugi et al. 1988 and Clah
 sen et al. 2004 for Williams Syndrome\, Smith & Tsimpli 1995 for language 
 savantism). Comparisons with typically developing children show greater or
  minimal variability\, depending on a number of factors such as age\, spee
 ch–language services (therapy\, rehabilitation\, intervention)\, methodo
 logy of data collection\, language-specific characteristics\, genetic make
 -up\, etc.\n\nInnovative methods of more effective and inclusive study\, a
 nalysis and rehabilitation to improve the linguistic abilities of individu
 als diagnosed with a language disorder have emerged over the past few year
 s. With this meeting we aim to bring together some of those methods.\n\nSp
 ecial Section on Down Syndrome:\n\nOne of these genetic disorders is Down 
 Syndrome. Down Syndrome is the most common cause of intellectual challenge
 s\, with the possible exception of Autism Spectrum Disorders. Despite of t
 his\, it has not been studied extensively across different languages. Cros
 s-linguistic inconsistencies on the (morpho)syntactic abilities of individ
 uals with Down Syndrome suggest that perhaps language-specific characteris
 tics could affect the way we view the linguistic abilities of individuals 
 with Down Syndrome. In addition\, the variability in studies on a specific
  language like English\, or across different languages\, ranging from “l
 ow functioning” individuals with minimal or no language production to hi
 ghly proficient individuals\, could also suggest that Down Syndrome may sp
 read across a spectrum. The variability in their linguistic abilities may 
 depend on a number of different factors related to either the genome—i.e
 . different types of Down Syndrome: trisomy 21\, translocation or mosaic
 —or other factors independent of the genetic make-up.\n\nThis special se
 ction aims to contribute to our understanding of language development in i
 ndividuals diagnosed with Down Syndrome and explore the linguistic challen
 ges that they face during or after the process of language acquisition. Ph
 ysiological and linguistic restrictions cause productions by individuals w
 ith Down Syndrome to differ from those of typically developing individuals
 . Determining the nature of those differences and exploring how they relat
 e across different languages may offer a different insight as to how the l
 anguage of individuals with Down Syndrome develops. It may also serve as a
  window into the properties of the human language faculty.

DESCRIPTION:The conference brings together scholars and graduate students 
 doing work under the theoretical framework first developed at Columbia Uni
 versity by the late William Diver. Columbia School linguists views languag
 e as a symbolic tool whose structure is shaped both by its communicative f
 unction and by the characteristics of its human users. In this functional 
 and semiotic conception of language\, the sign is proposed as the basic st
 ructural unit: a signal paired with a meaning. Signal-meaning hypotheses a
 re tested against actual usage and are often supported by quantitative pre
 dictions in texts. This mode of explanation is goal-directed rather than f
 ormal because the choice of a sign\, either grammatical or lexical\, is ex
 plained in terms of what the language user is attempting to accomplish. Th
 e model is inferential rather than compositional\, as messages are more th
 an the sum of their semantic parts. Language use is seen as creative in th
 e everyday sense of that word.

 iterary prose usually has little formal structure (there are\, say\, few o

DESCRIPTION:Workshop Description:\n\nThe goal of this workshop is to explo
 re questions about the morpho-syntax\, semantics and underlying ontology o
 f words and constructions used to describe dispositions. The central aim o
 f the workshop is to develop a better understanding of how existing and no
 vel insights from different approaches to dispositions can be integrated i
 nto a single theory of dispositions and their linguistic descriptions.\n\n
 Questions to be addressed by the workshop:\n\n1. What are the truth condit
 ions of dispositional statements?\n2. How are these truth conditions deter
 mined compositionally?\n3. In what ways can dispositions be linguistically
  expressed?\n4. What are linguistic tests for dispositionality?\n5. Are th
 ere distinct notions of ‘disposition’ between which a linguistic theor
 y of disposition description should distinguish?\n6. Among the words that 
 can be used to express dispositionality are nouns\, adjectives and verbs. 
 What systematic connections are there between the ways in which different 
 parts of speech do this\, in particular between deverbal nouns and adjecti
 ves and the underlying verbs?\n7. What role do temporal and aspectual sent
 ence constituents play in the verbal expression of dispositions?\n8. How d
 o dispositional statements differ from habitual and frequency statements?\
 n9. What relations are there between dispositions and causality?\n10. One 
 of the constructions that can be used to describe dispositions are middles
 . (An example: the German sentence `Dieser Satz liest sich leicht’ (‘T
 his sentence reads easily’)). Is ‘middle’ a morpho-syntactic or a no
 tional concept? Where do the argument positions of disposition-expressing 
 middles come from? What is the syntax-semantics interface for these constr
 uctions?\n\nFor a more detailed outline of the Workshop\, please consult t

DESCRIPTION:The Department of Linguistics and the Workshop on Linguistics 
 and Philosophy at the University of Chicago are organizing a one-day works
 hop on Modality and Subjectivity. \n\nThe treatment of modal expressions i
 n language is grounded in modal logic. Kratzer enriches the logical framew
 ork by introducing new parameters such modal bases and ordering sources. T
 hese enable a more refined interpretation of subtle distinctions such as e
 pistemic\, deontic\, bouletic\, and teleological modality (see Portner 200
 9).  At the same time\, ongoing crosslinguistic formal semantic work resul
 ted in broadening the phenomena studied under modality and revealed consid
 erable variation in the mapping between meanings and forms. As a result\, 
 modality has been connected to notions such as nonveridicality\, evaluatio
 n and bias (Giannakidou and Mari 2013).  There now seems to be consensus t
 hat by modalizing a sentence an individual anchor is\, at a very fundament
 al level\, commenting on the proposition\, and this commenting often invol
 ves weakening the epistemic commitment of the anchor. This appears to char
 acterize also evidential markers. Modality thus appears to involve subject
 ive dimensions (what individuals anchors believe or know\, what kind of ev
 idence they have)—and this is the broad context that serves as the backg
 round for our workshop. \n\nInvited Speakers:\n\nCleo Condoravdi\, Stanfor

DESCRIPTION:The Third Workshop on Metaphor in NLP (co-located with NAACL 2
 015)\nDenver\, Colorado\, USA – June 5\, 2015\nhttps://sites.google.com/
 site/metaphorinnlp2015/home\n\nWorkshop Description:\n\nMetaphor processin
 g is a rapidly growing area in natural language processing (NLP). The ubiq
 uity of metaphor in language has been established in a number of corpus st
 udies and the role it plays in human reasoning has been confirmed in psych
 ological experiments. This makes metaphor an important research area for c
 omputational and cognitive linguistics\, and its automatic identification 
 and interpretation indispensable for any semantics-oriented NLP applicatio
 n.\n\nThe work on metaphor in NLP and AI started in the 1980s\, providing 
 us with a wealth of ideas on its structure and mechanisms. The last decade
  witnessed a technological leap in natural language computation\, whereby 
 manually crafted rules gradually give way to more robust corpus-based stat
 istical methods. This is also the case for metaphor research. In the recen
 t years\, the problem of metaphor modeling has been steadily gaining inter
 est within the NLP community\, with a growing number of approaches exploit
 ing statistical techniques. Compared to more traditional approaches based 
 on hand-coded knowledge\, these more recent methods tend to have a wider c
 overage\, as well as be more efficient\, accurate and robust. However\, ev
 en the statistical metaphor processing approaches so far often focused on 
 a limited domain or a subset of phenomena. At the same time\, recent work 
 on computational lexical semantics and lexical acquisition techniques\, as
  well as a wide range of NLP methods applying machine learning to open-dom
 ain semantic tasks\, open many new avenues for creation of large-scale rob
 ust tools for recognition and interpretation of metaphor.\n\nThe main focu
 s of the workshop will be on computational modeling of metaphor using stat
 e-of-the-art NLP techniques. However\, papers on cognitive\, linguistic\, 
 and applied aspects of metaphor are also of interest\, provided that they 
 are presented within a computational\, a formal or a quantitative framewor
 k. We also encourage descriptions of proposals and data sets for shared ta
 sks on metaphor processing.

DESCRIPTION:After decades of seemingly scattered research\, the question o
 f how linguistics fits into the bigger picture of the sciences and the wor
 ld of knowledge in general has surfaced in connection with new methods and
  technological advances which deal with natural language and communication
 \, attempt to simulate them\, or use linguistic knowledge to interpret hum
 an behavior. This conference proposes a constructive take on the question 
 'Why?'\, as in\, why are we doing what we are doing as linguists\, and wha
 t is our contribution to knowledge? Or\, equally well\, what is the contri
 bution of a particular domain of linguistics to other disciplines\, and in
  turn\, their contribution to linguistics? To what end do linguistics and 
 any such neighboring fields of research or industry converge in their meth
 ods\, results and problem setting? This is intended to be the binding them
 e of this otherwise highly interdisciplinary event.\n\nInvited Speakers:\n

DTEND;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20150913T000000
UID:http://linguistlist.org/issues/26/26-920.html
DESCRIPTION:The workshop will be organized around the topic of errors prod
 uced and processed by humans and machines in multimedia\, multimodal and m
 ultilingual data with a particular focus on spoken language. It distinguis
 hes itself from other conferences addressing these issues by providing a f
 orum for dialogue and exchange between researchers working in linguistics\
 , including psycho- and neurolinguistics\, on the one hand\, and researche
 rs in computer science\, machine learning and multimedia speech and langua
 ge processing\, on the other hand. \n\nFor this interdisciplinary workshop
 \, we would like to gather these different communities around the issues o
 f variation\, ambiguity and errors in speech and language.  The purpose of
  this workshop is to share interdisciplinary expertise on a heterogeneous 
 phenomenon referred to as “variation” and “ambiguity” in some doma
 ins and as “errors” in others. Researchers are invited to share their 
 thoughts and observations through case studies run in the context of vario
 us initiatives.\n\nA large panel of research areas shares a common object 
 of study:  human language. These areas encompass historically well-establi
 shed research communities: classical humanities and social sciences (phone
 tics\, phonology\, psycholinguistics\, etc.)\, and more recent domains of 
 the sciences (brain and computer science). Research objectives include ana
 lyzing\, modeling\, understanding and theorizing the human processing of s
 peech variation. For linguists and psycholinguists variation in speech inv
 olves some matching process between variable surface forms and stable unde
 rlying forms: in such a framework errors may naturally arise as mismatches
  occurring at the interface of surface and underlying representations. Yet
  by which mechanisms errors may arise and how to interpret the patterning 
 of errors within theoretical models of speech production and perception ha
 s been a matter of controversy. Speech error research in recent years has 
 particularly highlighted the fuzzy boundary between the concepts of 'varia
 bility'\, ambiguity' and 'error'.\n\nResearch activities most often includ
 e corpora consisting of various types of recorded speech from controlled (
 laboratory) speech to large scale data. Such corpora may be a result of a 
 variety of capturing techniques from standard audio recordings to multi-se
 nsor capturing of either articulation gestures or brain activities. Errors
  can also be envisioned as a result of noisy data capturing conditions.\n\
 nSharing experience with errors\, variation and ambiguity is expected to p
 roduce beneficial insights for the different communities:\n\nConcerning hu
 manities\, variation and ambiguity are central to the different branches o
 f linguistics. Furthermore\, human production and perception errors challe
 nge the existing language acquisition\, production and perception models.\
 n\nFor automatic speech and language processing\, residual errors indicate
  regions which escape current modeling capacities. In-depth analyses in co
 llaboration with linguists\, psycholinguists and speech scientists may con
 tribute to a better understanding of these phenomena and to the proposal o
 f innovative strategies.\n\nBrain sciences\, a recent rapidly evolving res
 earch area\, open new opportunities and the study of errors can contribute
  to reveal the hidden organization of the brain.

 pli (University of Reading\, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki)\nDespoi
 na Papadopoulou (Aristotle University of Thessaloniki)\nChris Bongartz (Un
 iversity of Cologne)\n\nResearch investigating the language faculty has tr
 aditionally used questionnaire data\, grammaticality and acceptability rat
 ings. Language corpora along with off-line comprehension and production ex
 periments have addressed how language develops in monolingual and bilingua
 l children and adults and how it breaks down in adults with acquired langu
 age disorders and in children with developmental language disorders. Altho
 ugh these methods have provided invaluable findings about the speakers’/
 listeners’ knowledge and performance of language\, we do not have a comp
 rehensive picture of the linguistic and non-linguistic processes involved 
 when we produce or comprehend language in real-time and which of those pro
 cesses break down in language impaired populations.\n\nOver the last two d
 ecades\, new psycholinguistic methods\, such as reaction time\, ERP and fM
 RI experiments\, have opened a new dimension into the comprehension and pr
 oduction of language by allowing us to investigate not only the outcome of
  comprehension/production\, but also the linguistic and non-linguistic pro
 cesses that guide language comprehension and production. This research has
  demonstrated that language production and comprehension is mediated by a 
 range of different types of information\, such as lexical information\, se
 mantic plausibility\, syntactic information\, discourse information\, stat
 istical regularities\, and frequency of lexical co-occurrence (Altmann & S
 teedman\, 1988\; Pearlmutter & MacDonald\, 1995\; Taraban & McClelland\, 1
 988\; Tanenhaus & Trueswell\, 1995\; Trueswell\, 1996\; Trueswell & Tanenh
 aus\, 1994\; Trueswell\, Tanenhaus & Garnsey\, 1994). Healthy adults are c
 apable of coordinating these types of information to comprehend and produc
 e language\; it is less clear whether the same applies to children\, langu
 age learners\, and language impaired populations (e.g.\, Clahsen & Felser\
 , 2006\; Felser\, Roberts\, Marinis & Gross\, 2003\; Papadopoulou & Tsimpl
 i\, 2005\; Trueswell\, Sekerina\, Hill & Logrip\, 1999).\n\nPsycholinguist
 ic research investigating language processing of Greek has grown increment
 ally within the last decade including studies on language processing in he
 althy adults (Papadopoulou & Clashen\, 2003\; Manouilidou & Kehayia\, 2004
 \; Papadopoulou & Tsimpli\, 2006) and children (Papadopoulou & Tsimpli\, 2
 005\, Papangeli & Marinis\, 2009\; Papadopoulou et al.\, in press)\, adult
  second language learners of Greek (Papadopoulou & Tsimpli\, 2009)\, bilin
 gual children with Greek as one of their languages (Andreou et al.\, under
  review\; Torregrossa et al.\, 2015)\, child second language learners of G
 reek (Chondrogianni et al.\, 2014)\, adults with aphasia (Peristeri & Tsim

DESCRIPTION:Diachronic phonological and phonetic analysis provides great i
 nsight into language change\, whether it be due to general articulatory/pe
 rceptual pressures\, specific language-internal processes\, sociocultural 
 motivations or language contact.  Identifying historical sound changes is 
 also a crucial component of the comparative method\, which has been widely
  used to reconstruct unattested common ancestors of related languages.\n\n
 In the Amazonian context\, there have been numerous publications dealing w
 ith this topic over the decades (see for example Davis (1966) on Proto-Jê
 \, Rodrigues (1984/85) on Proto-Tupi-Guarani\, Girard (1971) on Proto-Taka
 nan\, Payne (1991) on Proto-Arawak\, Martins (2005) on Proto-Eastern Maku\
 , Chacon (2014) on Proto-Tukanoan\, inter alia).  However\, this will be t
 he first forum dedicated to historical phonology and sound change in the A
 mazon\, with special attention to methodological and analytical issues enc
 ountered in this region.\n\n

 jectif de ce colloque organisé par le réseau Lexicologie\, Terminologie\
 , Traduction (LTT) et l’Université de Strasbourg est d’examiner les n
 ombreux rapports que les mots nouveaux (ex. vapoter\, mot-dièse\, éviden
 t (i.e. facile)\, fachosphère\, vintage\, etc.) entretiennent nécessaire
 ment avec leur contexte linguistique et extralinguistique.\n\nEn effet\, q
 u’on l’appelle communément néologie\, ou néonymie en terminologie\,
  le processus général de création des mots nouveaux – dont l’emprun
 t et la néologie de sens par calque – n’est encore que trop rarement 
 et isolément décrit dans la relation à la situation de communication o
 ù ces mots inédits apparaissent. Plus précisément\, malgré les travau
 x pionniers des germanistes allemands et l'intérêt plus récent de la li
 nguistique de corpus pour la néologie\, l’approche contextuelle de la c
 réation lexicale peine à trouver sa place aux côtés des approches domi
 nantes qui\, pour l'essentiel\, relèvent d’une problématique dusigne i
 solé de son contexte\, comme en lexicographie ou en morphologie.\n\nOr le
 s unités lexicales nouvellement produites ne fonctionnent que dans une si
 tuation donnée et un texte particulier\, y remplissant notamment un rôle
  communicationnel précis (désigner une chose\, plaire\, convaincre\, etc
 .). Mieux\, les procédés de formation des mots eux-mêmes (par dérivati
 on\, par composition\, par métaphore\, etc.)\, utilisés par les locuteur
 s pour produire leurs innovations lexicales\, sont également contraints p
 ar plusieurs contextes\, dont le genre textuel en jeu\, la situation d’i
 ntercommunication et même l’environnement géoculturel.\n\nCalendrier d

DESCRIPTION:The Zentrum für Allgemeine Sprachwissenschaft (ZAS) will be h
 osting a two-day Workshop on Aspect in Embedded Clauses\, on May 11-12 in 
 Berlin\, Germany. The aim of the workshop is to explore the special behavi
 or of aspect (broadly construed) in embedded contexts. The presentations a
 t the workshop will investigate how embedding affects and constrains the m
 arking of aspectual distinctions and the interpretation of aspectual categ
 ories\, both relative to the matrix clause and in general. \n\nWe are plea
 sed to be able to announce Anita Mittwoch (The Hebrew University of Jerusa
 lem) and Susi Wurmbrand (University of Connecticut) as invited speakers fo
 r the workshop.\n\nA great deal of work has been done on the special prope
 rties of embedded clauses with respect to tense -- e.g. on sequence-of-ten
 se phenomena\, double-access readings and the restricted marking and inter
 pretation of tense in various types of non-finite clauses – but relative
 ly little has been done specifically on how aspect interacts with clausal 
 embedding. However\, it is clear that patterns of interest\, in part paral
 lel to those exhibited by tense\, are found here as well. E.g.\, just as t
 ense marking and interpretation are restricted in non-finite clauses\, at 
 least some such clauses disallow marking of aspectual distinctions\, and o
 thers place restrictions on the Aktionsart of their main predicate. Furthe
 rmore\, in languages with rich aspectual systems\, aspect marking in embed
 ded clauses plays a crucial role in determining temporal and event-structu
 ral relationships between matrix and embedded eventualities.

 une 10-11\, 2015\, Lancaster University\n\nThe study of implicit and expli
 cit learning plays a central role in the cognitive sciences. This two-day 
 symposium will bring together leading researchers from a variety of discip
 lines (cognitive psychology\, linguistics\, second language research\, cog
 nitive neuroscience\, and education) in order to critically appraise the r
 ole of implicit and explicit processes in language acquisition\, to discus
 s current trends\, and to outline future directions to take in this interd
 isciplinary enterprise. In order to facilitate discussion\, attendance is 
 limited to 30 participants.\n\nThe event will take place over two days. Th
 e first day (June 10) will consist of two hands-on workshops on the use of
  eye-tracking and electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate the cognitiv
 e and neural bases underlying implicit and explicit learning/knowledge. Th
 e second day (June 11) will feature three keynote talks and four invited p
 aper presentations by eminent researchers. There are no additional slots f
 or paper presentations\, but we will organize a poster session with space 
 for 20 presentations.\n\nConfirmed Speakers:\n\n- Sible Andringa (Universi

DESCRIPTION:Das Linguistik Meetup ist eine Veranstaltung für alle jungen 
 Sprachwissenschaftler*innen in Berlin und Potsdam\, die Lust haben\, ihre 
 Kolleg*innen aus anderen Instituten und Universitäten und ihre Forschungs
 interessen kennenzulernen. Mit seinen vier Universitäten (Freie Universit

 on von Linguist*innen. Trotzdem werden die Vorteile dieser außergewöhnli
 chen Konstellation allzu oft nicht wahrgenommen. Diese nicht erfreuliche S
 ituation zu ändern und die interessierten Sprachwissenschaftler*innen bes
 ser zu vernetzen\, sind die Hauptziele unseres Workshops. Er bietet allen 
 Studierenden (Bachelor\, Master\, Promotion) der Sprachwissenschaften in B
 erlin und Potsdam die Gelegenheit\, Forschungsprojekte in Vorträgen vorzu
 stellen (siehe Call for Papers)\, sich mit anderen jungen Sprachwissenscha
 ftler*innen auszutauschen und Kontakte zu knüpfen. Unser Ziel ist vor all
 em\, dass sich die interessierten Linguist*innen im Raum Berlin-Potsdam ke
 nnenlernen und dass sie von ihrer jeweiligen Forschung erfahren.\n \nDie t
 hematische Ausrichtung der Veranstaltung hängt völlig von den Forschungs
 interessen unserer Teilnehmenden ab. Wir sind in dieser Hinsicht ganz offe

SUMMARY:Hilbert’s Epsilon and Tau in Logic\, Informatics and Linguistics

DESCRIPTION:This workshop aims at promoting work on Hilbert’s epsilon ca
 lculus in a number of relevant fields ranging from Philosophy and Mathemat
 ics to Linguistics and Informatics. \n\nThe Epsilon and Tau operators were
  introduced by David Hilbert\, inspired by Russell's Iota operator for def
 inite descriptions\, as binding operators that form terms from formulae. O
 ne of their main features is that substitution with Epsilon and Tau terms 
 expresses quantification. This leads to a calculus which is a strict and c
 onservative extension of First Order Predicate Logic. The calculus was dev
 eloped for studying first order logic in view of the program of providing 
 a rigorous foundation of mathematics via syntactic consistency proofs. The
  first relevant outcomes that certainly deserve a mention are the two ''Ep
 silon Theorems'' (similar to quantifiers elimination)\, the first correct 
 proof of Herbrand’s theorem or the use of the Epsilon operator in Bourba
 ki’s Éléments de Mathématique. Nowadays the interest in the Epsilon s
 ubstitution method has spread in a variety of fields: Mathematics\, Logic\
 , Philosophy\, History of Mathematics\, Linguistic\, Type Theory\, Compute
 r science\, Category Theory and others.\n\nInvited Speakers:\n\nClaus-Pete
 r Wirth (University of Saarland): The descriptive operators iota\, tau and
  epsilon - on their origin\, partial and complete specification\, model-th
 eoretic semantics\, practical applicability\nVito Michele Abrusci (Univers
 ity of Roma Tre): Hilbert's tau and epsilon in proof theory.\nHartley Slat

DESCRIPTION:Organisers:\n\nPetros Karatsareas (University of the West of E
 ngland & Open University of Cyprus)\nJeanette Sakel (University of the Wes
 t of England)\n\nInvited Speaker: Professor Jason Rothman (University of R
 eading & UiT The Arctic University of Norway)\n\nWe are delighted to annou
 nce a one-day workshop on “Morphosyntactic interference in heritage lang
 uages” to be held at the Bristol Centre for Linguistics\, University of 
 the West of England\, Bristol on Thursday 11 June 2015 (11:00 – 18:00).\
 n\nHeritage speakers are typically the children of immigrants who are born
  in their parents’ host country. They normally grow up acquiring the lan
 guage of their parents’ country of origin at home until they start atten
 ding school\, at which time they start acquiring the majority language of 
 the host country. Gradually\, they become more fluent in the latter\, limi
 ting the use of the former to the interaction with family and friends from
  the same socioethnic background.\n\nResearch has shown that this acquisit
 ional trajectory distinguishes heritage speakers from both L1 acquirers an
 d L2 learners (see in particular Benmamoun et al. 2013\, Montrul 2008\, Po
 linsky & Kagan 2007 and references therein). On the one hand\, heritage sp
 eakers are exposed to the heritage language for most of their childhood\, 
 thus acquiring a significant part of its grammar on a par with native spea
 kers. On the other hand\, the stark reduction of domains in which the heri
 tage language is used and the consequent interruption of their acquisition
  results in a type of linguistic competence reminiscent of L2 learners. Th
 e interrupted acquisition of the heritage language\, possible subsequent a
 ttrition\, and interference from the majority language gradually leads to 
 the formation of heritage grammars characterised by innovations on all lev
 els\, from phonology and morphology to syntax and semantics.

DESCRIPTION:The study of pronouns has been an engine behind the developmen
 t of many theories in syntax and semantics. Much has been learned about pr
 onouns\, and yet the topic continues to be an area of fruitful research. L
 ively debates on strong and weak pronouns\, free and bound variable pronou
 ns\, de se and de re pronouns\, indexical pronouns and fake indexicals\, i
 ndefinites\, simplex and complex anaphors abound in the current linguistic
  literature. Many of the questions that we would like to address at our co
 nference are not new\, but we believe that addressing them again\, perhaps
  with new theoretical and experimental tools and with new data\, could be 
 quite helpful.\n\nHow exactly does syntax constrain the use of pronouns an
 d why are the constraints the way they are? What is the meaning of the fea
 tures of pronouns? What shapes pronominal systems in the world’s languag
 es? How does the human brain process pronouns and anaphora? How much can w
 e learn from studying pronouns about the laws of grammar and discourse?...
  \n\nThe discussion of these and related topics will surely benefit from t
 he contribution of our guest speakers who will also teach mini-courses on 
 the syntax\, semantics and processing of pronouns.\n\nInvited Speakers:\n\

DESCRIPTION:This conference aims to investigate ways in which comics explo
 re the idea of “future.” Its goal is to gather scholars from the field
  of comic studies and related fields\, such as linguistics\, philosophy\, 
 literary studies\, cultural studies\, sociology\, anthropology\, film stud
 ies as well as others that can discover a conceptual connection to the rig
 orous study of comics. Given our broad and yet specific purpose\, we aim t
 o discuss work on comics originating from all major traditions: French ban
 de desineé\, American and British comics\, Italian fumetti\, Japanese man
 ga\, and so on. In pursuing this cross-cultural approach\, we wish to disc
 uss not only how different conceptions of the future in comics can be comp
 ared and analysed\, but also how comics offer unorthodox modes of represen
 tation that allow for creative\, intellectual freedom that may be differen
 t from literature and cinema. In particular\, we are interested in\, but n
 ot limited to\, discussing these themes:\n\n- The cross-roads between utop
 ia and dystopia (e.g. Gundam’s Universal Century\, Transmetropolitan’s
  representation of life in “the city”\, Harlock’s 30th century\, the
  world of Rogue Trooper)\n- Apocalypses and new beginnings (e.g. Nausicaä
 ’s tragic millennium\, Authority’s new world\, X-Men’s days of futur
 e past\, El eternauta’s alien invasion)\n- The cities of the future (e.g
 . Dredd’s Mega city one\; Akira’s neo-Tokyo\; RanXeroX’s Rome)\n- Th
 e humans of the future: mutants\, augmented humans and cyborgs (e.g. Major
  Kusanagi in Ghost in the Shell\, Tony Stark in Iron Man\; 2000 A.D.’s A
 BC Warriors)\n- The politics of the future (e.g. Bilal’s Nicopol Trilogy
 \; Oshi’s Patlabor trilogy\; Marvel’s Civil War)\n- Time and history (
 e.g. Watchmen\; Planetary\, Neon Genesis Evangelion)\n- Nostalgia for futu
 re pasts (e.g. Nadia\, Arzach\, Tom Strong\, Satellite Sam)\n- Elaboration
 s and revisitations of futures in comics (Pluto\, Time2\, Le Transpercenei
 ge)\n- Futures set in stone\, and how to avoid or reach them (X-Men’s da
 ys of future past\; AppleSeed\, The Invisibles)\n\nWe hope to create a con
 ference that not only discusses these topics and uncovers how they have be
 en addressed in comics about the future\, but also to lay the foundations 
 of future research on these topics and develop new tools for advanced comi
 cs studies.

 guage seems to be the primary semiotic code (Halliday\, 1978). However\, i
 n this session\, multimodality can be also understood broader than that\, 
 closer to Barthes’ (1977) or Baudrillard’s (e.g. 2001) ideas of semiot
 ic systems other than language itself possessing structural regularities a
 ble to carry communicative load. In other words\, we aim at looking at mea
 ningful communicative  relations outside the spoken/written language and t
 he verbalized.\n\nIn accordance with the conference theme\, we want to exp
 lore how linguistic concepts could be understood and applied in the study 
 of multimodal communication. We also welcome new (multidisciplinary) resea
 rch frameworks which could help to grasp multimodality analytically. A vas
 t range of linguistic categories have already been productively used to ex
 plain the meaning-making mechanisms in multimodal communication\, whereas 
 concepts from outside linguistics have been incorporated into the theoreti
 cal framework of multimodal analysis to make such studies more in-depth an
 d insightful (e.g. contributions in Jewitt\, 2011). That is why\, apart fr
 om strictly linguistic frameworks\, we encourage discursive\, semiotic and
  anthropological analyses of all sorts of multimodal data: verbal\, visual
 \, paralinguistic and audio (including artistic discourse).\n\nThe main ob
 jectives are to: 1) provide a forum for discussion on linguistic concepts 
 in communication across modes\, channels and media\; 2) consider methodolo
 gies that allow studying language vis-à-vis other modes\; 3) trace new qu
 alities emergent through multimodal crisscrossing. 4) survey interrelation
 s of various facets of multimodal cultural space\; and 5) interrogate late
 st changes these might be undergoing. Possible foci include:\n\n- Verbal a
 nd non-verbal communication (e.g.\, gestures\, proxemics)\n- Culture as hi
 ghly structured text (e.g.\, space\, public display)\n- Iconic and visual 
 communication (e.g.\, imagery and symbols)\n- Textuality/orality in new me
 dia (e.g. multimodal ensembles)\n- Multimodal corpora in research\n- Multi
 modal rhetoric(s)\n- Media/visual literacy

DESCRIPTION:The Section Spanish and Portuguese of the Linguistics Departme
 nt of Ghent University is proud to announce the conference Ibero-Romance L
 anguages in Contact and in Contrast.\n\nAs is the case with any other natu
 ral language\, the Ibero-Romance languages have entered in contact with di
 verse languages\, due to their particular historical\, geographical and po
 litical situations. The resulting diversification is apparent at the inter
 continental\, international\, national and local level. Obvious examples a
 re the European and Latin-American variants. Moreover\, the colonialist an
 d commercial endeavours that were undertaken in the previous centuries hav
 e contributed to the emergence of particular language contact situations o
 ver different continents\, which have been an inexhaustible source of inte
 resting language phenomena that have caught linguists’ attention. Theref
 ore\, the Ibero-Romance languages\, as languages in contact and contrast w
 ith other languages\, can be studied from various perspectives and within 
 different approaches. In particular\, interested researchers are kindly in
 vited to present their work relating to the following issues:\n\n– Compa
 rison of different varieties from the local to the intercontinental level 
 (e.g. European\, Latin-American\, and African varieties\, minority languag
 es\, …)\n– Contrastive syntactic\, semantic and/or pragmatic analyses 
 of two or more (Ibero-) Romance languages (e.g. the study of cognates in s
 yntax and in the lexicon such as\, the diverging polysemy of similar lexem
 es\, different grammaticalization paths\, the contrastive study of grammat
 ical constructions\, the dative\, …)\n– Linguistic fixation and standa
 rdization (cf. orthographic norms\, language politics\, etc.)\n– Languag
 e contact inside the Ibero-Romance area \n– Creole languages\, Judeo-Spa
 nish\, Spanglish\n– Ibero-Romance case studies that show that language c
 ontact can both accelerate and slow down linguistic change\n– Case studi
 es on the convergence or divergence of the Ibero-Romance languages\n– Gr
 ammaticalization due to language contact\n\nPlenary Speakers:\n\n- Johanne

DESCRIPTION:Grammaticalization theory has been one of the most powerful fr
 ameworks of non-formal grammar in the past two decades internationally and
  has also increasingly engendered research in Japan in the past 10 or so y
 ears. Yet\, despite the exponential increase in published research\, and a
  strong research impetus originally coming from the study of African langu
 ages\, main stream understanding of grammaticalization processes is still 
 tightly bound to knowledge obtained from a very limited number of language
 s. However\, studies on grammaticalization in less-studied languages give 
 us good reason to believe that there are considerable differences in diffe
 rent types of languages especially with respect to formal aspects of gramm
 aticalization. At this juncture\, where grammaticalization research has gr
 eatly matured in general\, the opportunity is ripe to investigate this iss
 ue in more depth.

DESCRIPTION:Recently\, the study of verbal aspect as a grammatical categor
 y\, from both a typological and an individual linguistic point of view\, h
 as developed rapidly. This is the most grammaticalized and complex facet o
 f a heterogeneous aspectual semantic zone. Moving in this direction\, the 
 main subject of verbal aspectual study was identified at previous internat
 ional conferences on verbal aspect organized as part of the research proje
 ct run by the International Commission on Aspectology of the International
  Committee of Slavists. At the third conference\, “Verbal Aspect: Gramma
 tical Meaning and Context” held in Padova\, questions on the relationshi
 p between aspect and context were mainly discussed. At the fourth conferen
 ce\, “The Semantic Scope of Slavic Aspect” held in Gothenburg\, the ce
 ntral focus of analysis became the many-sided nature of an aspectual seman
 tic zone of slavic languages.\n\nIn view of the objective outlined above\,
  the main purpose of the fifth conference is consideration of various syst
 ems of verbal aspect\, from both a synchronic and diachronic perspective. 
 The following important questions for discussion are suggested:\n\n- The r
 elationship between components of an aspectual semantic zone\, such as asp
 ectual grammemes\, actional tags and classes\, as well as tools of transfo
 rmation of actional characteristics of predicates\n- The relationship betw
 een an aspectual semantic zone and other semantic zones\n- The relationshi
 p between an aspectual semantic zone and the morphosyntactic organization 
 of the sentence\n- The relationship between aspectual semantic zone and di
 scourse strategies\n- The scripts of diachronic progresses of systems of v
 erbal aspect:\ngrammaticalization of an aspectual semantic zone\, processe
 s of perfectivation and imperfectivation\, and so forth\n\nThe object of a
 nalysis will be not only all Slavic languages\, but also a comparison betw
 een Slavic languages and other natural languages which express aspect by d
 ifferent means.\n\nInvited speakers: E. V. Paducheva\, V. S. Khrakovskij  
 \n\nRegistration Fee:\n\n1. Full-time participation\n\n1) Participation in

DESCRIPTION:This DGfS-AG aims to bring together theoretical and experiment
 al accounts of different concepts of agentivity and their influence on eve
 nt interpretation. Events are usually identified by their spatio-temporal 
 properties. However\, the way participants are engaged in an event also pl
 ays a major role (e.g. Eckardt 2002). While the impact of the semantic pro
 perty of an incremental theme (or patient) on event interpretation has bee
 n widely discussed (following e.g. Krifka 1998)\, the influence of the (po
 ssibly contextually driven) semantic properties of the agent or causer rol
 e on event interpretation is still understudied\, particularly from an exp
 erimental perspective. We also have a poor understanding of the impact of 
 different agentivity features (or entailments\, e.g Dowty 1991) on event i
 nterpretation. Additionally\, a related open question is to what extent ev
 ent interpretation is semantically determined and/or pragmatically driven.
  \n\nA primary focus lies on accounts that try to integrate experimental d
 ata and theoretical considerations with respect to agentivity in event int
 erpretation. The AG will serve as a discussion forum for researchers from 
 different fields such as theoretical syntax and semantics\, psycho- and ne
 urolinguistics at the syntax-semantics interface and experimental pragmati
 cs. \n\nReferences: \n\nEckardt\, Regine. 2002. Event semantics. In: Fritz

DESCRIPTION:No language or dialect is intrinsically superior or inferior t
 o another\, and yet\, because of social conventions\, as well as academies
  and other prescriptive institutions\, speakers invest languages with valu
 e that affects the way we perceive them. Variations of a language—whethe
 r dialects\, sociolects and/or registers—may mark the position of the sp
 eaker within a sociocultural hierarchy. Usually\, in cases in which two or
  more languages are in contact\, one of them will gain prestige and will e
 ither be imposed on the linguistic community whose language is considered 
 to have a lower status or become accessible only to a few members belongin
 g to an elite.  Governments may influence the use or disuse of particular 
 languages or dialects through language policy or legislation.

DESCRIPTION:To review the status of Dravidian Tribal Linguistic Studies an
 d discuss the future course of actions. New descriptions\, documentation\,
  planning policies for the development of Dravidian Tribal Languages\, inp
 ut to Comparative Dravidian Linguistics are the expected outcomes.\n\nThe 
 Dravidian Linguistics in general and Comparative Dravidian Linguistics in 
 particular have been giving considerable attention to study the lesser kno
 wn Dravidian Tribal Languages (DTL) since the time of Robert Caldwell. Amo
 ng the 26 identified Dravidian languages 20 are spoken by the tribal commu
 nities. Due to the shift in the interest to generative grammar\, socioling
 uistics etc\, the relative lull in the Dravidian tribal linguistic studies
  was visible in the recent past. The speech forms of many of these communi
 ties are yet to be described. Some of the speech forms already described v
 iz.\, Abujhamaria\, Adiyaa\, Aamaden\,  Aalu Kurumba\, Betta Kurumba\, Che
 nchu\, Cholanaikan\, Kaani\, Kasaba\, Kaattunaikka\, Kisaan\, Kaikadi\, Ma
 lamaakku\, Muduga\, Muthuva\, Naikidi\, Paniya\, Uuraali\, Yenaadi Yerukal
 a etc. are yet to be determined whether they are dialects or independent l
 anguages. The status of some of the new ‘languages’ such as Koya\, Ind
 i Ave are to be decided. Scholars often emphasize that the data from the t
 ribal languages are indispensable for Comparative Dravidian Linguistics\, 
 cultural history etc. Meanwhile\, lesser known tribal languages are at dif
 ferent state of endangerment because of the changed socio-political\, econ
 omic and other reasons such as the advent of revolution in the mass commun
 ication. Reflecting upon the above contexts\, a Two-Day National Seminar o
 n “Dravidian Tribal Linguistics: Retrospect and Prospects” will be org
 anized on 26-27 March 2015.

DESCRIPTION:According to the Fregean principle of compositionality\, the m
 eaning of a complex expression is determined by the meanings of its parts 
 and the rules used to combine them. This principle is flouted in the case 
 of idioms (cf. Katz & Postal 1963\; Fraser 1970\; Katz 1973\; Chomsky 1980
 \; Machonis 1985\; Schenk 1994\; Grégoire 2009\; among others). Every lan
 guage contains idiomatic expressions which\, by definition\, denote a mean
 ing that is not simply derivable from (the combination of) the meanings of
  the individual lexical items of that expression. A canonical example is k
 ick the bucket\, the meaning of which has nothing to do with either kickin
 g or buckets\; it simply means 'to die'. The existence of such expressions
  within natural language gives rise to many questions which have puzzled l
 inguists for years\, such as how these phrases are formed syntactically\, 
 whether they are restricted to certain structural domains\, or how it is t
 hat we are able to deduce the idiomatic interpretation of such phrases des
 pite there being no clues as to their meanings within any of the individua
 l lexical items that comprise these expressions.\n\nThe purpose of this wo
 rkshop is to discuss and explore the phenomenon of idioms with the aim of 
 gaining better theoretical and empirical insights into how such expression
 s are able to occur within natural language\, and what sorts of rules of l
 anguage they are governed by.\n\nInvited Speakers:\n\n- Christiane D. Fell

DESCRIPTION:4REAL Workshop\nWorkshop on Research Results Reproducibility a
 nd\nResources Citation in Science and Technology of Language\n\n28 May 201
 6\nPortorož\, Slovenia\n\nCollocated with LREC2016 \n10th Language Resour
 ces and Evaluation Conference \nhttp://lrec2016.lrec-conf.org\n\nThe discu
 ssion on research integrity has grown in importance as the resources alloc
 ated to and societal impact of scientific activities have been expanding (
 e.g. Stodden\, 2013\, Aarts et al.\, 2015)\, to the point that it has rece
 ntly crossed the borders of the research world and made its appearance in 
 important mass media and was brought to the attention of the general publi
 c (e.g. Nail and Gautam\, 2011\, Zimmer\, 2012\, Begley and Sharon 2012\, 
 The Economist\, 2013).\n\nThe immediate motivation for this increased inte
 rest is to be found in a number of factors\, including the realization tha
 t for some published results\, their replication is not being obtained (e.
 g. Prinz et al.\, 2011\; Belgley and Ellis\, 2012)\; that there may be pro
 blems with the commonly accepted reviewing procedures\, where deliberately
  falsified submissions\, with fabricated errors and fake authors\, get acc
 epted even in respectable journals (e.g. Bohannon\, 2013)\; that the expec
 tation of researchers vis a vis misconduct\, as revealed in inquiries to s
 cientists on questionable practices\, scores higher than one might expect 
 or would be ready to accept (e.g. Fanelli\, 2009)\; among several others.\
 n\nMaking justice to and building on the inherent ethos of scientific inqu
 iry\, this issue has been under thorough inquiry leading to a scrutiny on 
 its possible immediate causes and underlying factors\, and to initiatives 
 to respond to its challenge\, namely by the setting up of dedicated confer
 ences (e.g. WCRI – World Conference on Research Integrity)\, dedicated j
 ournals (e.g. RIPR – Research Integrity and Peer review)\, support platf
 orms (e.g. COS – Center for Open Science)\, revised and more stringent p
 rocedures (e.g. Nature\, 2013)\, batch replication studies (e.g. Aarts et 
 al\, 2015)\, investigations on misconduct (e.g. Hvistendahl\, 2013)\, etc.
 \n\nThis workshop seeks to foster the discussion and the advancement on a 
 topic that has been so far given insufficient attention in the research ar
 ea of language processing tools and resources (Branco\, 2013\, Fokkens et 
 al.\, 2013) and that has been an important topic emerging in other scienti
 fic areas. That is the topic of the reproducibility of research results an
 d the citation of resources\, and its impact on research integrity.\n\nOrg

DESCRIPTION:In many respects\, what is expressed by means of the utterance
  of a sentence depends on the context in which the utterance takes place. 
 Theorists have attempted to explain this context-relativity in various way
 s. One broad approach is to build context-relativity into the formal seman
 tics of natural language. This conference will deal with controversies tha
 t arise within this approach to countenancing context-relativity.\n\nWe ar

DESCRIPTION:Dialogue as Global Action: Interacting Voices and Visions acro
 ss Cultures\n\nAs social human beings\, we participate in a wide range of 
 multi-layered dialogues in various contexts\, in a shared search for incre
 ased understanding of issues and phenomena\, for questioning ideas and act
 ions\, for joint problem-solving. These dialogues have dramatically increa
 sed with the widespread use of social media\, which now enable members of 
 any social\, gender\, ethnic\, racial or cultural group to raise and make 
 their voices heard while articulating current concerns and addressing crit
 ical issues of inequality\, discrimination\, socio-political underrepresen
 tation and misrepresentation. At the same time\, having a voice is not eno
 ugh Couldry 2010):  we need to make sure that our voice matters. While joi
 ning in a dialogic polyphony of voices\, each voice shares a particular ex
 perience\, viewpoint\, or sets of attitudes to reality\, all of which are 
 instrumental in shaping actions\, interactions and relationships. \nThe ai
 m of this conference is to take the local and global dialogue to a higher 
 level by extending its scope and empowering role as a springboard for crit
 ical reflection and self-reflection\, for in-depth issue problematisation\
 , for multi-voiced interpersonal resonance\, for constructive polyphony of
  complementary voices.\n\nAuthors are invited to present papers on a broad
  spectrum of research topics (both discipline-specific and multi-disciplin
 ary) that include\, but are not restricted to the following:\n\n- Multiple
  voices in online dialogue\n- Voicing standpoints in multimodal communicat
 ion\n- Voices in dialogue across time and space\n- Gendering voices in pub
 lic and/or private dialogue\n- Voices interacting in cross-cultural dialog
 ue\n- Public and private voices in sustained dialogue\n- Trust-building in
  face-to-face and/or virtual dialogues\n- Competing and collaborative voic
 es in dialogue\n- Polyphony of voices in harmonious or disharmonious dialo
 gue\n- Intertextuality in multi-voiced dialogue

 \n- Welche Einsichten\, Instrumente und Generalisierungen der theoretische
 n Linguistik können für die Grammatikschreibung fruchtbar gemacht werden
 ? \n- Inwieweit muss sich die theoretische Linguistik an ihrem Vermögen m
 essen lassen\, tiefere Erklärungen für die in der Grammatikschreibung ta

DESCRIPTION:Spaces obtain meaning because of the role they play in human e
 vents or conceptualisations of the world. The descriptions and interpretat
 ions of these spaces are intertwined with human objectives and values. The
 se could be determined by prevalent ideologies\, whether political\, socia
 l or cultural. As such\, names are artefacts of social\, political\, cultu
 ral and demographic discourses. They importantly also serve as a reflectio
 n of identity\, both cultural and collective\, thereby denoting a range of
  diversities\n\nGiven that society is dynamic and the accompanying determi
 ning factors are also in flux\, names are sometimes changed to reflect new
  realities. In other instances they are left unchanged. Nevertheless\, top
 onymic landscapes generally capture to a lesser or greater extent the dive
 rsity of their context and also largely relate strongly to the heritage of
  name givers. For many people changes in place names have a bearing on the
 se aspects. One therefore often finds that orchestrated place name changes
  become an instrument of legitimation for one section of a society and are
  therefore being contested by another section of the society. This prompts
  questions about the management of place names in diverse societies and th
 e role of heritage associated with place names.\n\nThis symposium follows 
 on the very recent one held in Rome\, Italy (17 – 18 November 2014)\; an
 d will follow shortly on the ones in Moscow and Rio de Janeiro\, both in A
 ugust 2015. It seeks to specifically investigate the relation between plac
 e names\, diversity and heritage.

DESCRIPTION:The workshop deals with impersonals such as Germanic 'man'-pro
 nouns\, impersonal middles and impersonally used pronouns (e.g. third pers
 onal plurals) in comparative perspective.\n\nHuman impersonal pronouns suc
 h as German and Norwegian man (e.g. Man lebt nur einmal\, Man lever bare e
 n gang. 'One only lives once') pose a number of challenges to descriptive 
 linguistics as well as contemporary syntactic and semantic theories. They 
 generalize over (sets of) human referents and background the argument posi
 tion that they fill\, thus having a semantic effect similar to that of rel
 evant operations on argument structure like impersonal passives (e.g. Ge. 
 Es wurde getanzt 'People danced') and impersonal middles (e.g. Sp. Se habl
 a español 'Spanish spoken'). A subset of the human impersonal pronouns ca
 n be interpreted more or less like existential indefinite pronouns such as
  Sp. alguien and Ge. jemand\, though they differ systematically from the l
 atter in their semantic and syntactic properties.\n\nIn a bilateral cooper
 ation project (ANR/DFG) on impersonals\, we have investigated the syntacti
 c and semantic properties of human impersonal pronouns such as Ge. man and
  Engl. one and compared them with impersonal uses of second person singula
 r (tu/du/you) and third person plural pronouns (ils/sie/they)\, or the cor
 responding forms of verbs (e.g. Russian Zhiveš' tol'ko raz 'One only live
 s once'\, V Gollandii často provodât vystavki cvetov 'They often hold fl
 ower exhibitions in Holland'). The project combines a crosslinguistic over
 view with detailed semantic and syntactic investigations to bridge the gap
  between accurate empirical research and contemporary theorizing in the do
 main of impersonals. More generally\, the project aims to make a contribut
 ion to our understanding of the interaction between lexically and grammati
 cally encoded information on the one hand\, and information contributed by
  the context\, on the other.\n\nIn this workshop we aim to present some of
  our results and discuss recent developments in the analysis of R-imperson
 als with international specialists working on this domain.\n\nVenue: Fried
 rich-Schiller-University of Jena\n\nOrganizers:\n\nProject on Towards a ty
 pology of human impersonal pronouns\, jointly funded by the ANR and the DF

DESCRIPTION:Institute of English at the University of Silesia\, has the pl

 nsions of Contrastive Studies / Różne wymiary studiów kontrastywnych (V
 -DOCS 2015). Although the tradition of contrastive studies has a very long
  history\, the approach to this type of studies has been constantly changi
 ng with the emergence of new linguistic theories and approaches to underst
 anding the notion of language. Today\, the scope of contrastive studies ra

DESCRIPTION:New Developments in the Quantitative Study of Languages\nHelsi
 nki\, August 28–29\, 2015. \n\nIn recent decades a number of linguistic 
 sub-disciplines have witnessed a paradigm shift towards more empirical res
 earch. In phonetics\, socio- and psycholinguistics statistical methods hav
 e already been employed for a long time. More recently\, the application o
 f quantitative research methods has become a major trend in many other res
 earch areas\, such as language typology\, first and second language acquis
 ition\, historical linguistics and language contact\, to name but a few. T
 he analysis of increasingly large datasets has also called for the adoptio
 n of statistical techniques.\n \nThe goal of this symposium is to bring to
 gether researchers from different frameworks within quantitative linguisti
 cs to discuss new methods in language studies and new applications of exis
 ting ones.\n\nThe following plenary speakers have confirmed their particip

DESCRIPTION:Prominence relations establish a ranking between linguistic un
 its\, such as prosodic units\, arguments of a verb and discourse referents
 . Prominence is therefore one of the key notions in language and communica
 tion: it accounts for prosodic highlighting and the building of linguistic
  structure and discourse representations. Accordingly\, the study of promi
 nence requires an interdisciplinary linguistic approach\, involving phonol
 ogy and phonetics\, syntax\, semantics and discourse pragmatics. Our confe
 rence aims to foster the understanding of the notion of prominence.\n\nThe
  conference will feature plenary talks in the fields of phonetics-phonolog
 y\, morphosyntax-semantics and discourse by three keynote speakers:  \n\nS
 ónia Frota (University of Lisbon) \nManfred Krifka (ZAS/Humboldt Universi

DESCRIPTION:Some of the most interesting questions in philosophy and scien
 ce are the ones whose answers at first seem obvious: How do we know what e
 xists? Why does an apple fall from a tree instead of floating up? One of t
 he central questions in philosophy of language and linguistic semantics in
  the 20th century was how we refer using proper names. It may seem obvious
  that a name refers to the person who bears it through an accord in that i
 ndividual’s speech community\, and that this referent is featured in the
  semantic content of utterances involving the name. This simple answer is 
 reflected in Saul Kripke’s influential proposal dating from the 1970s. B
 ut by itself it fails to account for observations about the full range of 
 uses of names. How can our theory cover names without referents\, like ''A
 thena'' or ''Bugs Bunny''? And consider identity statements\, in connectio
 n with which one of the central figures in the early literature on proper 
 names\, Gottlob Frege\, remarked: “Identity challenges reflection”. Si
 nce Hesperus and Phosphorus both refer to the same planet\, Venus\, how ca
 n ''Hesperus is Phosphorus'' mean something more than ''Hesperus is Hesper
 us''? Closely related is the question of how to account for problems of de
  re belief attribution and denial: ''Thales didn’t believe that Hesperus
  was Phosphorus'' should not be taken to attribute to Thales a failure to 
 appreciate the law of identity. And how are referential uses of names rela
 ted to predicative uses\, as in ''There are ten Venuses in the directory''
 ? The challenge is to capture the distinctive aspects of these various use
 s while still providing a unified\, overarching analysis of names\, one wh
 ich does justice to the intuitively appealing\, simple answer entertained 
 above.\n\nContemporary work on these issues is being conducted by both lin
 guists and philosophers\, and the nature of the topic and some of the reca
 lcitrant problems facing extant accounts call for their collaborative inte
 raction. Accordingly\, our invited participants include scholars from both
  fields. The workshop will consist of six extended sessions over two days\
 , each led by one of our invited speakers\, with ample time for discussion
  and interaction with the distinguished group of invited discussants.  We 
 have a website where participants can share papers and links to other rele
 vant work\, in preparation for our discussions.  \n\nOthers with appropria
 te background are cordially invited to join us.  Please let us know by May
  5th if you would like to attend\, so we can plan accordingly.

 4 October 2015 and will focus on communication and interactions stemming f
 rom networks such as the Internet or telecommunications\, as well as mono 
 and multimodal\, synchronous and asynchronous communications. The focus of
  the IRC will encompasses different CMC genres. These include\, but are no
 t limited to\, discussion forums\, email\, SMS\, text chat\, wiki discussi
 ons\, discussions in multimodal and/or 3D environments.\n\nThe aim of the 
 IRDs is to bring together researchers who have collected CMC data and who 
 wish to organize and share them for research purposes. The IRDs will focus
  on the process of buidling CMC corpora including annotation and analysis 
 processes as well as the  questions of ethics and rights raised by publish
 ing CMC corpora as open data.

DESCRIPTION:The Romance Turn conferences bring together researchers from a
 cross Europe and overseas with the aim of communicating results and develo
 ping further research in the acquisition of Romance languages\, compared t
 o the acquisition of other languages. Language acquisition studies both in
  children and adult learners are central to building our understanding of 
 human language and how it develops in the brain. The field has witnessed a
  continuous growth during the past three decades. Over this period\, empir
 ical evidence provided by research conducted on the acquisition of Romance
  languages such as French\, Italian\, Catalan\, Spanish\, Romanian and Por
 tuguese has become increasingly productive. The linguistic properties of R
 omance languages (i.e.\, syntactic\, semantic\, morphological and phonolog
 ical features) make these languages excellent testing-grounds for both wel
 l-known and alternative theories of language acquisition.\n\nKeynote Speak

 al information sites\, peer-support sites for patients\, mailing lists\, o
 nline counselling services\, and so on. In these contexts\, language plays
  a central role in how health issues are communicated and how health-relat

 Elizabeth Sillence\, Northumbria University Newcastle  \n- Wyke Stommel\, 
 Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen\n\nConference Themes:\n\nCovering a broad ra
 nge from mental and medical health issues to healthy life style concerns\,
  the symposium aims to explore how language is used in e-health practices:
 \n\n- To construct the patient-doctor/client-therapist relationship\n- To 
 persuade users of healthy lifestyle changes\n- To give support among peers
  (e.g. in online support groups)\n- To establish trust in peer-to-peer and
  in professional-lay contexts\n- To create expertise by lay people and pro
 fessionals\n- To talk about specific illnesses and health risks\n- To adap
 t content and language for target groups (kids\, teenagers\, adults\, part
 icular conditions\, etc.)\n\nThe symposium provides a platform for researc
 hers and practitioners from different disciplines such as linguistics\, ps
 ychology and anthropology\, as well as the public to share findings and in
 sights concerning e-health communication. By engaging in a dialogue with r
 esearchers from different fields we work towards a better understanding of
  e-health practices overall\, which can be of use and interest to health p
 ractitioners as well. This symposium is going to be the endpoint of the SN
 F-funded research project “Language and Health Online” (NGK1912).\n\nC

DESCRIPTION:Recent years have seen increased interest in applying logical 
 methods and frameworks\, the traditional subject matter of ESSLLI\, to cog
 nitive modeling\, whereby logical models of cognitive phenomena are tested
  against empirical data. At the same time\, there has recently been an exp
 losion of activity in the cognitive sciences around (structured) statistic
 al\, and specifically Bayesian\, models. With this workshop we propose to 
 bring together two groups of researchers — logicians focused on cognitiv
 e modeling\, and cognitive scientists incorporating logical structure into
  probabilistic models — with the aim of cross-pollination\, and ideally\
 , a consensus on how these two traditions relate\, and how we might combin
 e the best of what both have to offer. The primary aim is to gain a better
  understanding of:\n\nHow cognitive computational models could be enriched
  by logical insights?\nHow logical models may be turned into cognitive mod
 els?\n\nThe workshop will take place as part of the 27th European Summer S
 chool in Logic\, Language and Information (ESSLLI 2015).

 Zusammenhang die Annahme zu bewerten\, dass gesprochene Texte schon als In

DESCRIPTION:Taal & Tongval: Language Variation in the Low Countries is a p
 eer-reviewed journal primarily devoted to the study of language variation 
 in the Dutch language area\, which organizes an annual one-day colloquium 
 on a current topic in variational linguistics (cf. http://www.taalentongva
 l.eu). The theme of the 2015 edition is: ‘Borrowing: pragmatic and varia
 tional linguistic approaches’.  It will take place at the Royal Academy 
 for Dutch Language and Literature (KANTL) in Ghent on 27 November 2015.\n\
 nBeing one of the most visible forms of contact-induced variation and chan
 ge\, lexical borrowing has received ample attention in linguistics since t
 he early twentieth century. Studies on the topic have long been conducted 
 from a structuralist\, system-oriented perspective\, identifying types of 
 loanwords according to their degree of morpho-phonological nativization\, 
 charting borrowability of parts of speech and providing lexicographical in
 ventories for loanwords found in corpora (but see Poplack et al. 1988 as e
 arly exception).\n\nRecently\, new perspectives have been introduced from 
 various angles\, studying the pragmatic and social value of loanwords in s
 ociety and discourse. The overarching question addressed is why language u
 sers choose what type of foreign material in which contexts to achieve whi
 ch social or pragmatic effect. \n\nAmongst others\, research along these n
 ew lines:\n\n- Patterns sociolinguistic variation in the use of loanwords 
 (Zenner et al. 2014)\, explores the link between globalization\, glocaliza
 tion and borrowing (Sifianou 2010)\n- Studies the borrowability of items b
 eyond the single word level: (1) paying attention to borrowed phraseology 
 and borrowed constructions (see Backus 1999\; Furiassi et al. 2012)\; (2) 
 looking into pragmatic\, discursive and gestural borrowing (Andersen 2014\
 ; Peterson & Vaattovaara 2014)\n- Charts receptor language users’ creati
 vity in molding and altering source language material\, amongst others in 
 the form of: (1) bilingual punning (Stefanowitsch 2002\; Knöpfe forthcomi
 ng)\; (2) pseudo loanwords (Furiassi & Gottlieb 2015)\; (3) constructional
  change (Doğruöz & Backus 2009\; Van de Velde & Zenner 2009)\n- Verifies
  the pragmatic necessity of loans\, contrasts the use and function of sour
 ce language material with (e.g. French merci ‘dank je wel’ in Dutch) a
 nd without (e.g. English Laptop in German) receptor language alternatives 
 (Onysko & Winter-Froemel 2011\; Zenner et al. 2012)\n- Describes the pragm
 atic processes that trigger and explain variation in the morpho-phonologic
 al adaptation of loanwords (Winter-Froemel 2013)\n- Measures how the use o
 f foreign language material impacts speaker attitudes in applied genres (e
 .g. advertising\; Van Meurs 2010) or specialized groups (e.g. youth langua
 ge\; Androutsopoulos 2005)\n- Looks for methodological innovations to stud
 y these different issues\, e.g. by means of (1) inferential statistics (On
 ysko & Calude 2013)\, (2) experimental techniques (Van Meurs et al. 2013)\
 , or (3) automatic data extraction (Andersen 2005\, Alex 2008)\n\nThese an
 d other topics\, which can equally be applied to issues relating to gramma
 tical borrowing\, will be discussed during the colloquium. Additionally\, 
 there is room for regular 20-minute conference presentations.

DESCRIPTION:Most of the data used to explore and explain phonetic variatio
 n in the speech of foreign language learners was recorded on a small-scale
  in experimental research. Likewise language learner corpora are usually b
 ased on written rather than on spoken data whereas phonetically annotated 
 corpora of various speech styles do not explicitly consider language learn
 ers as speakers. However\, we notice a growing number of research using la
 rge-scale collections of phonetic learner data as well as the development 
 and investigation of full-fledged phonetic learner corpora. The aim of thi
 s half-day workshop is to bring together researchers working with large-sc
 ale data sets of speech in a background of foreign and second language lea
 rning. The target audience comprises colleagues setting up learner corpora
 \, experts in phonetic corpora\, researchers with phonetic and phonologica
 l experiments in L2 acquisition\, and those with an interest in phonetic a
 spects of L2 teaching and non-native speech in general.\n\nInvited Speaker

 ual environments\, with special attention on the languaging and constructi
 on of time and space in virtual sites. A specific interest in ViLS-2 relat
 es to alternative approaches towards the study of Time\, Space and Place. 
 How are these co-created in interaction when people\, both inside and outs
 ide educational arenas\, engage with a fluid supply of information and res
 ources? The 2015 ViLS-2 conference will include presentations by invited s
 cholars\, peer-reviewed short-listed paper authors as well as provide oppo

DESCRIPTION:The usage and polysemy of spatial expressions have been resear
 ched in a number of linguistic works. Prolific research into space and its
  expression in different languages has contributed to supporting the weak 
 hypothesis of linguistic relativity (cf. Levinson and Wilkins 2006). There
  are interesting papers dealing with motion events (Talmy 1985\; 2000)\, a
 cquisition of spatial expressions in the first (e.g. Hickmann 2003) and se
 cond language (e.g. Tyler 2012). Since 1980s research into space has incre
 asingly relied on the cognitive framework. However\, inflecting languages 
 have received very little attention. It is worth mentioning several papers
 \, all of them dealing with Slavic languages\, for example\, Przybylska (2
 002)\, Šarić (2008) and Pawelec (2009).\n\nSpace conceptualization in th
 e Baltic languages has been so far rather under-researched. Besides some o
 lder descriptive and structural works on the expression of space\, current
 ly there have been attempts to investigate spatial relations within the co
 gnitive linguistic framework across several languages. Some typological wo
 rks based on the material of the Baltic languages have also appeared. Stil
 l there is an obvious niche in the field and many more discussions are nee
 ded.\n\nThe section primarily focuses on (but is not limited to) the follo
 wing topics:\n\n1.	Methodologies of researching space: trends and approach
 es. Methodologies applicable to the Baltic languages.\n2.	Strategies of sp
 ace construal and conceptualization.\n3.	Linguistic expression of topologi
 cal and projective spatial relations\, motion events.\n4.	Linguistic expre
 ssion of size\, measurement\, orientation\, etc.\n5.	Space typology (inclu
 ding materials from the Baltic languages).\n6.	Polysemy of spatial express
 ions. Motivation of meaning.\n7.	Expression of space and diachronic studie
 s.\n8.	Expression of space and grammaticalization. \n9.	Expression of spac
 e across languages. Translation.\n10.	Acquisition of spatial language.\n11
 .	Expression of space in the Baltic sign languages.

DESCRIPTION:The expression of polarity contrast that is particularly promi
 nent in languages like German and Dutch has recently been in the centre of
  empirical as well as theoretical investigations. In these languages\, con
 trasts between statements with negative and positive polarity are marked w
 ith the help of prosody (nuclear pitch accent on the finite verb or comple
 mentizer\, i.e. verum focus\, cf. Höhle 1992\, Blühdorn & Lohnstein 2012
 ) or assertive particles (wel/wohl\; toch/doch\; schon) that also carry fo
 cal stress (Blühdorn 2012\, Hogeweg 2009\, Sudhoff 2012\, Turco\, Braun &
  Dimroth 2014).\n\nTo date there is no consensus on the exact meaning cont
 ribution of these devices or on the kind of contrast that is actually evok
 ed. Possibilities under discussion include assertion vs. non-assertion (Kl
 ein 2006)\, polarity (Turco\, Braun & Dimroth 2014)\, illocution (Höhle 1
 992)\, and sentence mood (Lohnstein 2012). Other open questions concern th
 e fate of the verum operator in case it is not focused (Gutzmann 2012)\, t
 he question how similar assertive particles and verum focus really are (Su
 dhoff 2012)\, how comparable contexts are expressed in other languages (Di
 mroth\, Andorno\, Benazzo & Verhagen 2010)\, what the specific parameters 
 of the prosodic marking of verum focus are (Turco\, Dimroth & Braun 2013)\
 , and how they relate to other kinds of prosodic focus marking. With few e
 xceptions\, this vivid debate is not informed by empirical data. \n\nThe w
 orkshop wants to bring together researchers from a theoretical and an empi
 rical orientation and to enhance our understanding of the phenomenon with 
 the help of cross-linguistic comparisons. It mainly focuses on (but is not
  restricted to) West-Germanic languages. We welcome contributions dealing 
 with the syntactic\, semantic\, pragmatic and/or prosodic aspects of the p
 henomenon.\n\nInvited Speakers:\n\nHorst Lohnstein (University of Wupperta

DESCRIPTION:The conference theme this year is “Moving towards an Integra
 tion of Language and Culture”. As we realize that language is inseparabl
 e from its culture\, it is of paramount importance to integrate the knowle
 dge of culture into language classroom. The main objective of the 2015 con
 ference is to find promising ways to emphasize cultural awareness or cultu
 ral sensitivity in the practice of teaching and learning a foreign languag
 e. With the understanding of the culture of the target language and the lo
 cal culture of each nation\, we can prepare our people to be able to commu
 nicate with the population of the world successfully. In addition\, the co
 nference also aims to reflect the splendid heritage and cultural diversity
  of the Asian region which should be preserved and shared with others outs
 ide the region. - See more at: http://www.ilac.dusit.ac.th/conference/call

DESCRIPTION:While literacy in Southern Africa has been studied from a vari
 ety of interdisciplinary perspectives\, much research has focused on Engli
 sh and Afrikaans with comparatively little on the acquisition of the cogni
 tive precursors to – and linguistic components of – literacy in indige
 nous African languages.   Much research remains to be done on cognitive is
 sues such as phonological awareness\, morphological awareness\, semantic p
 rocessing\, vocabulary development and the interplay between linguistic th
 eory\, linguistic structure and literacy acquisition.  Of particular conce
 rn is the absence of general linguistic\, theoretical linguistic and psych
 olinguistic perspectives in the South African discussion (De Vos\, Van der
  Merwe & Van der Mescht 2014\; De Vos & Riedel 2011). \n\nAt the moment\, 
 little is known of how the issues of orthographic complexity\, integrity a
 nd transparency interact with morphology and dialect in African languages 
 or how these translate into norms and standards which can inform curriculu
 m statements.  Consequently\, we know relatively little of the sequence\, 
 pace or relative difficulty of becoming literate in an African language.  
 \n\nRelatively recently\, there have been calls for this type of research 
 to take centre stage (De Vos\, Van der Merwe & Van der Mescht 2015 forthco
 ming).  Thus Schroeder (2014) calls for “linguistically savvy curricula
 ” and work is developing in Zulu eyetracking (Pretorius  & Van Rooy 2013
 \, Land 2013) phonological awareness (Diemer 2013\,  Wilsenach 2013\, De S
 ousa & Broom 2010\; De Sousa\, Greenop & Fry 2010)\, Morphological awarene
 ss ( Ortner 2014) and lexical recognition (Probert 2014\, Probert & De Vos
  2014).\n\nNevertheless\, there remains much work to be done: there are cu
 rrently no reading speed or vocabulary norms for any indigenous South Afri
 can language and no indices of textual complexity (such as the Fleisch tes
 t etc.  This has a number of effects: (i) educators are denied important l
 earning tools to gauge and benchmark learner progress\, thus adding to the
  strain of teaching (ii) there are few diagnostic tools to identify learne
 rs who are lagging behind or who may have learning difficulties\, dyslexia
  etc.  (iii) learning resources are developed without an appreciation of h
 ow the structures of language interact with literacy\; for instance\, dire
 ct translation of basal readers and curricula result in resources that are
  misleading or inappropriate (Katz & Bikitsha 2014) (iv) government policy
  and curricula is developed in the absence of deep understandings of the l
 anguage-particular underpinnings of literacy practices.\n\nThe workshop wi
 ll explore these and related issues\, focusing on the linguistic and psych
 olinguistic systems underpinning literacy in indigenous African languages\
 , particularly  those of the Bantu language family and attempting to draw 
 together linguistic theory and applied literacy research.    In addition\,
  it aims to raise awareness\, promote research and build networks to deal 
 with these issues.  \n\nKeynote speakers: \n\nHelen Abadzi (University of 
 Texas at Arlington)\nDr Carien Wilsenach (University of South Africa).

DESCRIPTION:Functional Linguistic and Social Semiotic Approaches to the Me
 dia\n\nBeyond their current social hype\, the media have long since been o
 f major concern to linguists. Rooted in rhetorical notions of effectivenes
 s and appropriateness\, featuring in early models of communication (e.g. J
 AKOBSON)\, surfacing in the principled division of speech and writing and 
 a key idea in text theory (cf. register/mode\, HALLIDAY/HASAN) and languag
 e variation\, the concept of medium has recently been gaining ground in di
 scourse/text linguistics and general linguistic theory. Some would go as f
 ar as to claim independent disciplinary status to an ever-growing field of
  media linguistics. Despite the wealth of notions of medium\, there would 
 seem to be linguistic consensus on at least three relevant key elements of
  the concept.\n\n1. Technological: Media are primarily seen as the technol
 ogical means and infrastructure enabling and shaping the use of language. 
 Technical frameworks like radio\, TV\, printing\, new and social media lea
 ve traces in the linguistic styles and the texture of the discourse constr
 ucted. Each medium comes equipped with its own material-situational constr
 aints and affordances.\n\n2. Semiotic: Viewing media as sign systems or se
 miotic modes opens up a multimodal approach to text and discourse\, which 
 seeks to describe the patterns of mode co-operation\, combination and inte
 gration. In this view\, we ask for medium-specific multimodal patterns of 
 texture. But fundamental mode differences\, like the question of the auton
 omy or interdependence of speech and writing\, also come to the fore.\n\n3
 . Socio-Cultural/Pragmatic: Finally\, from a sociolinguistic and pragmatic
  point of view\, media can be recast as socially constituted forms of text
 ual practice. In this view\, what is highlighted is the pragmatic routines
  and design patterns within media institutions\, which affect genres and t
 heir linguistic/multimodal styles. Here we must also ask how relations bet
 ween communicators are shaped by the medium used.

 mar and lexicon. \n\nParticular attention will be given to questions like 
 the following:\n\n-What are the processing differences between production 
 of grammatical and production of lexical items? Are these differences simi
 lar to differences pertaining to perception of grammatical and lexical ite
 ms?\n- Are different brain areas involved in the processing of grammatical
  and lexical items?\n- Are agrammatic symptoms better accounted for in ter
 ms of specific linguistic disorders (e.g.  the Derived Order Problem Hypot
 hesis\; Bastiaanse & van Zonneveld\, 2003) or in terms of pure processing 
 deficits (e.g. Kolk & Heeschen\, 1992)?\n- Are there modality-specific pro
 cessing differences between grammar and lexicon? For example\, are there p
 rocessing differences found only in written languages?

 ciative ».\nThe question of speaker subjectivity within the text\, and of
  the representation of the speaker through texts\, will be discussed from 
 a variety of theoretical perspectives – enunciative\, lexicological\, pr
 agmatic\, syntactic\, translation studies – and approached through diffe
 rent text types\, encouraging the intersection of various approaches to a 
 theme that has so far been largely unexplored from a contrastive corpus-ba

DESCRIPTION:VU University Amsterdam (The Netherlands) and Language and Cul
 ture Research Centre (Australia) are pleased to announce a special worksho
 p on Comparative and Superlative Constructions\, to be held at the VU Univ
 ersity in Amsterdam\, 16-17 June 2015. \n\nThe term ‘comparative constru
 ction’ is defined in the literature as a way of comparing two participan
 ts (objects) with regard to a certain kind of property (Dixon 2008\; Heine
  2003\; Stassen 1985\, 2011). Consider the English example in (1) (after D
 ixon 2008):\n\n(1) John is more handsome than Felix. \n\nOf course\, many 
 languages have comparative constructions unlike those in English\, from se
 rial verb constructions that include verbs of exceeding or surpassing to v
 arious types of bi-clausal constructions.  Cross-linguistically\, it is no
 t uncommon to find a range of comparative constructions in one language. B
 ut in some linguistic areas\, such as New Guinea\, one frequently finds no
  dedicated\, grammaticalized forms of comparison. Instead\, comparative an
 d superlative readings are contextually inferred from the use of intensifi
 ers with adjectives. Or speakers use comparative strategies that heavily r
 ely on contextual implications of juxtaposed utterances of type (2). If th
 ere is some grammatical coding\, languages in this area tend to leave key 
 elements of the comparison implicit\, especially standards.  \n\n(2) John 
 is big. Harry is not. \n\nThere are indications that comparative construct
 ions have a relatively high degree of borrowability and potential to diffu
 se. In linguistic areas traditionally poor in dedicate comparative constru
 ctions\, dominant languages of wider communication may supply speakers of 
 minority languages with grammatical models through calquing (Dixon 2012: 3
 71\, e.g. Malay\, Turkish\, English models).\n\nIn this workshop\, we will
  examine comparative constructions from a cross-linguistic perspective. By
  paying attention to lesser studied languages and language families\, we a
 im to explore the morphological\, syntactic and semantic properties of com
 parative constructions\, as well as to address the question of their diach
 ronic origins and borrowability. Our point of departure is\, but is not re
 stricted to\, Dixon’s (2008) seminal work on the typology of comparative
  constructions. \n\nReferences\nDixon\, R. M. W. (2008). Comparative const

DESCRIPTION:The conference focuses on the ways in which cultural heritage 
 narrative\, vocabulary and imagery intertwine in tourist guidebooks in pas
 sages dedicated to urban spaces\, landscapes\, architecture\, figurative a
 rt and crafts. \n\nWhich words and images are used to describe cultural he
 ritage assets? How are certain items selected through narratives and what 
 is instead left out? What is the role of the author(s) in selecting which 
 cultural assets to include in a guidebook and how to represent them lingui
 stically and figuratively? How do images and the lexical repertoire stabil
 ize to the point of becoming stereotypical? What is the interplay of text 
 and images? These are some of the questions that will be explored.\n\nOn t
 he one hand\, the conference aims to investigate tourist guidebooks as the
  locus where the real or virtual tourist experience is shaped and\, theref
 ore\, their key contribution to the creation of the image of the destinati
 on and its heritage. Through description and narration\, guidebooks become
  intermediaries between the reader and the cultural heritage of the destin
 ation.  On the other hand\, guidebooks should be studied in terms of their
  relationship with the individual reader\, guiding them through a cultural
  space and focusing on the most representative aspects of specific places 
 and epochs. Moreover\, their influence is not limited to the time of trave
 l\; they also represent a textual space capable of organizing the travelle
 r’s memories by bringing together actual spaces and the tourist’s subj
 ective experience of them. \n \nWho Can Participate:\n \nThe research un
 it on the Vocabulary of Cultural Heritage is interdisciplinary and multili
 ngual in nature and investigates the synergy between text\, language and i
 mages. The conference aims at bringing together scholars working in the fi
 elds of linguistics\, literature\, geography\, architecture\, history\, ph
 otography\, and communication. Travellers are also welcome to participate 
 in the debate. \n\nPossible Topics:\n\n- The vocabulary of cultural herita
 ge in tourist guidebooks from synchronic or diachronic perspectives\n- Tra
 nslated touirst guidebooks\n- Different editions of tourist guidebooks\n- 
 The images of cultural heritage in tourist guidebooks in synchronic or dia
 chronic perspectives \n- The imagery of cultural heritage \n- The protagon

 al media have a considerable impact on communicative repertoires in that t
 hey promote new forms of literacies and provide alternative communicative 
 dynamics and structures\, involving monolingual and multilingual speakers 
 alike. This means that the communicative practices and repertoires of peop
 le can potentially be transformed.\n\nThe aim of this conference is to exp

 many different kinds of corpora. These range from small\, but carefully an
 notated treebanks to large parallel corpora and very large monolingual cor
 pora for big data research. It remains a challenge to query the multilayer
  annotations of small corpora\, to efficiently access large corpora as wel
 l as to visualize the query results.\n\nWhen dealing with large corpora\, 
 query tools need to scale in terms of processing speed and reporting throu
 gh statistical information and visualization options. This becomes evident
 \, for example\, when dealing with very large corpora (such as complete Wi
 kipedia corpora) or multi-parallel corpora (such as Europarl or JRC Acquis
 ). The goal of the workshop is to gather researchers who develop or evalua
 te new corpus query and visualization tools for linguistics\, language tec

DESCRIPTION:We are pleased to announce that the Tunica-Biloxi Tribe will h
 ost the 35th Siouan and Caddoan Languages Conference (SCLC) in Marksville\
 , LA this year from June 12 through June 14. The deadline for abstract sub
 missions is April 30\, 2015.\n\nThe Siouan and Caddoan language families o
 f the Great Plains\, like most other indigenous languages of the Americas\
 , are understudied and in need of additional attention. The SCLC has aimed
  over the past three decades to rectify this problem through soliciting pr
 esentations on language description\, theoretical linguistics\, philology\
 , and other topics relevant to the study of Siouan or Caddoan languages.\n

DESCRIPTION:The European Society of Phraseology (EUROPHRAS) is organising 
 its 2015 conference in Malaga\, Spain\, from  29 June to 1 July 2015. The 
 city of Malaga\, with its rich history spanning more than two thousand yea
 rs since its foundation by the Phoenicians\, boasts an important cultural 
 infrastructure and rich artistic heritage. It has always been a multicultu
 ral and cosmopolitan city with one of the biggest Mediterranean seaports a
 nd a busy international airport. Combining its rich traditions\, the comfo
 rts of a modern city\, and its warm and sunny climate\, Malaga makes an id
 eal location for the 2015 EUROPHRAS conference.\n\nIn keeping with this ye
 ar’s title\, “Computerised and Corpus-based Approaches to Phraseology:
  Monolingual and Multilingual Perspectives”\, it will be focused on vari
 ous technology-related topics within phraseology. More specifically\, the 
 conference intends to create a platform for the presentation and discussio
 n of the most recent and advanced computational and corpus-based methods a
 pplied in phraseology\, and consequently to promote further development an
 d innovations in the field\, including not only monolingual\, but also mul
 tilingual phraseology and translation.\n\nIn conjunction with EUROPHRAS 20
 15\, the second Workshop on ''Multi-word Units in Machine Translation and 
 Translation Technology'' (WSMUTTT) will take place as an associated event.
  The first edition of the workshop was successfully held at the Machine Tr

DESCRIPTION:Conference co-organised by GEHLF\, HTL\, SIDF and SHESL\n\nGiv
 en the way disciplines are structured\, the history of linguistic thought 
 and the history of different languages have often been treated in parallel
 \, and the intersections and convergences between them have not been prope
 rly examined. However\, this was not always the case. Ferdinand Brunot’s
  monumental History of the French Language\, for instance\, moves constant
 ly between these two domains. More recent examples for French are provided
  by the work of Jean Stéfanini (1962) or Jean-Pierre Seguin (1993). And i
 n another tradition\, the case of Steinthal (1890-1891) may be seen as a m
 odel case of this double focus on the history of a language and the histor
 y of its analysis.\n\nThe availability today of large-scale corpora\, both
  for the analysis of linguistic usage and for the study of metalinguistic 
 texts\, should make this confrontation easier. How far have the new method
 ologies developed both for the history of languages and for the history of
  linguistic ideas given fresh impetus to the exploration of the relationsh
 ip between the two disciplines?\n\nProgramme Organisers:\n\nWendy Ayres-Be

DESCRIPTION:The English & Translation Society (ETS) at Sultan Qaboos Unive
 rsity\, Oman\, is hosting the 12th Annual Translation Symposium on 18 – 
 20 May 2015. Organized by students\, the event will seek to provide a plat
 form for participants to discuss diverse theoretical and practical aspects
  of the role of translators and interpreters in delivering quality service
  to the local community. Translators and interpreters make communication p
 ossible between people who have no common language. They are especially im
 portant in administrations\, in companies and in courts. The symposium\, t
 herefore\, aims to shed light on this increasingly important and growing f
 ield\, in the English-Arabic translation context.\n\nThe issues to be exam
 ined concern the following:\n\n- Translation and interpreting practices in
  public and private sectors \n- Translation strategies and norms \n- Ethic
 s of the profession \n- Applied analysis of translations in such pragmatic
  contexts as the economy\, finance\, law\, science\, medicine\, advertisin
 g\, media\, and the internet. \n\nETS invites participants to discuss the 
 relationship between translators/interpreters and the community by address
 ing the following questions:\n\n- What is the role assumed by translators 
 and interpreters in the public and private sectors?\n- To what extent do i
 nstitutional norms constrain the performance of translators/interpreters?\
 n- What strategies do translators/interpreters employ in delivering their 
 translations?\n- How do shifts in translation impact on clients and their 
 perception of information? \n\nWe welcome submissions for 30-minute presen
 tations that consider any of the above issues. Please\, send your abstract
  (roughly 200 words) and proposals for workshops to Dr. Hisham Jawad at  h
 ajawad@squ.edu.om by 25 April 2015.\nWorking languages: English & Arabic

DESCRIPTION:Language can be perceived as a habitat\, a more or less enclos
 ed space (idiolect\, jargon)\, a more or less open and permeable terrain (
 plurilingualism\, neology) in which and by which humankind inhabits\, live
 s and evolves. Just like the dwelling which protects yet sometimes impriso
 ns\, familiar language reassures and ostracises at once. Language\, which 
 can be assimilated to a dwelling\, an abode or even a roof\, represents a 
 refuge for mankind while allowing cohabitation\, living together and excha
 nge. Between the open and the closed\, language and architecture aim at a 
 balanced exchange between speaking subjects and living subjects.\n\nThe ju
 xtaposition of habitat\, a product of architecture\, and speech\, a produc
 t of language\, will enable the perception of a double orientation of what
  could be named “architexture”\, i.e. urbanistic discourse analysis on
  the one hand\, and the exploration of the architecture of language\, on t
 he other hand.\n\nKeynote speaker: Zoltán Kövecses – Eötvös Loránd

  for diversity and cooperation is ever-present. Since 2014\, LSUGA has end
 eavored to host a yearly conference that serves to showcase the interdisci
 plinarity and interrelations of linguistics. Our ILC focuses on the interd
 isciplinarity of linguistics with other fields and even the interface betw
 een its different subfields. This conference aims to showcase linguistic e
 xperiences that have had positive results when incorporating two or more s
 ubfields in order to solve a problem or answer a research question. Whethe
 r it is the marriage of formal and functional theory or a joint venture be
 tween separate disciplines\, working together provides researchers with a 
 way to handle data and analyze findings in new and innovative ways.\n\nThe
 refore\, both formal and applied work is enthusiastically accepted!  In 20
 15\, there will be a special session for research on Amer-Indian and other
  indigenous languages\, so those who work in these areas are especially en
 couraged to apply.

DESCRIPTION:Logic was originally meant to systematize and analyze argument
 s in natural language. But in the 20th century the main developments in lo
 gic focused on mathematics and its foundations. Recently\, a number of res
 earchers have focused on logical systems tuned to natural language semanti
 cs to reconnect with the older tradition. The logical and conceptual under
 pinnings of some of these systems remains unclear\, although some recent w
 ork has begun to address formal foundations.\n\nThe aim of this conference
  is to contribute to this direction in semantics and to discuss logics\, e
 specially proof systems\, well-suited for natural language semantics and t
 o explore comparisons between these systems. We also welcome input from pe
 ople invoved in computational semantics\, psychology of reasoning\, and co
 mputer implementations of natural reasoning systems.

 RSPEECH conferences emphasize interdisciplinary approaches addressing all 
 aspects of speech science and technology\, ranging from basic theories to 
 applications. \n\nINTERSPEECH 2015 will be organized around the theme Spee
 ch beyond Speech: Towards a Better Understanding of the Most Important Bio
 signal\, which acknowledges the fact that speech is the most important bio
 signal humans can produce and perceive. It is evident that not all charact
 eristics of speech are already fully understood. We therefore encourage co
 ntributions that analyze and model speech as a biosignal in a broad unders
 tanding\, e.g. for extracting information about the speaker\, for identify
 ing processes leading to speech production\, or for generating speech sign
 als with specific bio-characteristics. Contributions to all other areas of
  speech science and technology are also welcome.

 king''\n\n(BPA\, 1995\, Chap. IV\, Article 82 ). Along with factors such a
 s race\, class\, and age comes the concept of gender as a critical sociocu

DESCRIPTION:In the beginning was the word … and then … technology\n26-
 28 November 2015\nTirana\, Albania \n\nTechnology has been part of human l
 ife since the early ages. If language\, identified in the call with the 
 ‘word\,’ developed in the first place to enable human communication\, 
 technology grew out of the need to cope with the environment\, namely out 
 of the need to eat\, to work\, to feel protected and also to communicate. 
 \n\nEvery age in the history of mankind is witness to great advances of te
 chnology\, which have contributed not only to improving and facilitating l
 ife in general as well as to speeding up scientific progress but also to c
 hanging mentalities\, shaking beliefs\, shuffling and reorganizing human o
 rder. What is more\, these advances have cherished the fantasy of men and 
 writers thus giving way to science fiction.  Writers have envisioned trave
 l on the moon\, robots\, eternal life\, life on other planets and many oth
 er things. They have encouraged mankind to challenge itself and make the i
 maginable real.  \n\nIn the recent decades\, technology has advanced to a 
 tremendous speed that it is so difficult to keep pace with it. The applica
 tions of technology in the field of communication but not only are manifol
 d to the point that they have transformed and redefined many aspects of hu
 man life. Whilst on the one hand\, these have facilitated life in general 
 and human communication in particular\, they have also brought the need to
  revisit several concepts and ideas related primarily to them.\n\nIf once 
 communication was first and dictated developments in technology\, it can n
 ow be claimed that technology comes first and dictates the way we communic
 ate.\n\nAlthough the applications of technology are countless\, the confer
 ence seeks to particularly explore the intersections between word and tech
 nology\, that is\, to trace all possible applications of technology in lan
 guage\, literature and culture.

DESCRIPTION:Teaching Western Armenian in the Armenian Diaspora in the 21st
  century means facing several challenges\, from very theoretical ones (L1 
 vs. L2 vs. heritage language\, acquisition vs. learning\, language endange
 rment and literacy) to the practical issues (class organization\, assessme
 nt\, pedagogical innovation\, professional development for teachers\, Arme
 nian as second language training for teachers\, etc.) that follow from the
 m.\n\nAlthough these issues may be discussed in depth among specialists of
  language acquisition and teaching\, the agents in the field (teachers\, s
 chool directors\, etc.) are still too isolated in their everyday duties to
  be concerned about seeking out and implementing research-based best pract
 ices. This is partly due to the lack of applied research specifically conc
 erning Armenian language acquisition and teaching. The purpose of this con
 ference is to bring together specialists of language acquisition and teach
 ing\, scholars as well as stakeholders of successful models of second lang
 uage / heritage language teaching\, concerning the Armenian language and c
 omparable situations\, in order to outline the priorities of an applied re
 search program for the Western Armenian language today.

DTEND;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20150704T000000
UID:http://linguistlist.org/issues/26/26-1506.html
DESCRIPTION:The open access movement in scientific publishing and search e
 ngines like Google Scholar have made scientific articles more broadly acce
 ssible. During the last decade\, the availability of scientific papers in 
 full text has become more and more widespread thanks to the growing number
  of publications on online platforms such as ArXiv and CiteSeer. The effor
 ts to provide articles in machine-readable formats and the rise of Open Ac
 cess publishing have resulted in a number of standardized formats for scie
 ntific papers (such as NLM-JATS\, TEI\, DocBook)\, full-text datasets for 
 research experiments (PubMed\, JSTOR\, etc.) and corpora (iSearch\, etc.).
  At the same time\, research in the field of Natural Language Processing h
 ave provided a number of open source tools for versatile text processing (
 e.g. NLTK\, Mallet\, OpenNLP\, CoreNLP\, Gate\, CiteSpace). \n\nScientific
  papers are highly structured texts and display specific properties relate
 d to their references but also argumentative and rhetorical structure. Rec
 ent research in this field has concentrated on the construction of ontolog
 ies for citations and scientific articles and studies of the distribution 
 of references . However\, up to now full-text mining efforts are rarely us
 ed to provide data for bibliometric analyses. While bibliometrics traditio
 nally relies on the analysis of metadata of scientific papers\, we will ex
 plore the ways full-text processing of scientific papers and linguistic an
 alyses can play. With this workshop we like to discuss novel approaches an
 d provide insights into scientific writing that can bring new perspectives
  to understand both the nature of citations and the nature of scientific a
 rticles. The possibility to enrich metadata by the full-text processing of
  papers offers new fields of application to bibliometrics studies.\nWorkin
 g with full text allows us to go beyond metadata used in bibliometrics. Fu
 ll text offers a new field of investigation\, where the major problems ari
 se around the organization and structure of text\, the extraction of infor
 mation and its representation on the level of metadata. Furthermore\, the 
 study of contexts around in-text citations offers new perspectives related
  to the semantic dimension of citations. The analyses of citation contexts
  and the semantic categorization of publications will allow us to rethink 
 co-citation networks\, bibliographic coupling and other bibliometric techn
 iques. \n\nThe workshop aims to bring together researchers in bibliometric
 s and computational linguistics in order to study the ways bibliometrics c
 an benefit from large-scale text analytics and sense mining of scientific 
 papers\, thus exploring the interdisciplinarity of Bibliometrics and Natur
 al Language Processing. \n\nWorkshop topics include (but are not limited t
 o) the following:\n\n- Linguistic modeling and discourse analysis for scie
 ntific texts\n- User interfaces\, text representations and visualizations\
 n- Structure of scientific articles (discourse / argumentative / rhetorica
 l / social)\n- Scientific corpora and paper standards\n- Act of citations\
 , in-text citations and Content Citation Analysis\n- Co-citation and bibli
 ographic coupling\n-Text enhanced bibliographic coupling\n- Terminology ex
 traction\n- Text mining and information extraction\n- Scientific informati
 on retrieval\n- Ontological descriptions of scientific content\n- Knowledg

DESCRIPTION:Workshop Description:\n\nDisplacement is a fundamental propert
 y of human language\, and the restrictions on displacement have been a cen
 tral concern in generative grammar ever since Ross’ (1967) ground-breaki
 ng observations of island constraints. While island phenomena have been in
 vestigated in detail from various perspectives (see Sprouse & Hornstein 20
 13\, Boeckx 2012 and references therein)\, a different empirical domain\, 
 the domain of freezing\, has received less attention. The Freezing Princip
 le has originally been defined as a constraint which blocks extraction of 
 and from constituents in non-canonical / non-base positions (originally We
 xler & Culicover 1980\, see Corver 2006 for an overview). The aim of the w
 orkshop is to look into the domain of the Freezing Principle in relation t
 o other restrictions on extraction in order to contribute to a broader und

DESCRIPTION:Phonological Theory Agora\nStandup sessions: make a claim and 
 defend it\nhttp://pta.cnrs.fr/\n\nFrench CNRS and seven partner institutio
 ns outside of France have created a network \n(called GDRI in the French j
 argon) designed to promote discussion around phonological \ntheory: PTA (P
 honological Theory Agora). PTA makes a number of assumptions that \nframe 
 its activity:\n\n1. Both theories of symbolic representations and computat
 ion are needed\n2. Phonology and phonetics are distinct systems\n3. Demons
 trations that are not based on corpus data and/or statistical relevance ma
 y be \nconclusive\n\nFrom 2015 to 2018\, PTA organizes one conference a ye
 ar (maybe among other things)\, \nwhich will be travelling to different ci
 ties. The first venue is Lublin / Poland\, and will lean \non the APAP con
 ference that two Lublin Universities organize independently (http://\nwww.
 apap.kul.pl/): APAP takes place on June 19-21\, PTA continues on June 22-2
 3.\n\nEach PTA venue has a theme. Lublin is about the relationship between
  derivation and \nrepresentation. In order to promote discussion\, rather 
 than professoral declamation\, the \nbasic conference format is standup-st
 yle: speakers make a claim and provide supporting \nargument (10 min.)\, w
 hich is then discussed by the floor (20 min.). Before this session\, the \

DESCRIPTION:We are happy to announce the 5th specialised seminar of the In
 ternational Association for \nResearching and Applying Metaphor (RaAM)\, w
 hich will take place on 10-12 June 2015 in \nLeiden\, the Netherlands. The
  seminar will be hosted by the Leiden University Centre for \nLinguistics 
 (LUCL).\n\nhttp://www.hum.leiden.edu/lucl/research/conferences/upcoming-co
 nferences/raam-\n2014.html\n\nThe theme of the 2015 seminar is “Metaphor
 s in/and/of Translation”. The goal of the \nseminar is to advance the st
 udy of metaphor (and other forms of figurative language) \nthrough the ana
 lysis of metaphors in and of translation. By considering how metaphors \na
 re translated in different domains of discourse (e.g.\, legal texts\, lite
 rature\, business \ncommunication and science)\, and how different tools (
 e.g.\, corpora\, MIP(VU)) can be used \nto investigate real-world issues i
 n translation theory\, practice and education\, the seminar \naims to add 
 to our understanding of metaphor as a matter of language\, thought and \nc
 ommunication in interlingual and intercultural settings. The seminar will 
 promote \nmultidisciplinary\, cross-cultural research and collaboration an
 d will encourage the use of \ndifferent theoretical frameworks and researc
 h methods.\n\nPlenary Speakers:\n\n- Prof. Jean Boase-Beier\, University o
 f East Anglia (UK)\n- Prof. Christina Schäffner\, Aston University (UK)\n
 - Dr. Dimitri Psurtsev\, Moscow State Linguistic University (Russia)\n\nTh
 e programme will combine plenary talks with a number of hands-on\, real-wo
 rld \nworkshops. In addition\, regular 20-minute paper presentations and a
  poster session will be \norganised.

SUMMARY:The Dynamics of Wordplay / La dynamique du jeu de mots

DESCRIPTION:Wordplay can be regarded as a ubiquitous phenomenon. It appear
 s in a broad range of situations of communicative exchange\, including spo
 ntaneous manifestations in everyday communication\, strategic uses in adve
 rtising messages and argumentative texts as well as literary texts from di
 fferent authors\, cultures and historical periods. At the same time\, word
 play is to a certain extent ephemeral: the ludic character of utterances c
 an get lost over time as they become reused in other contexts\, and in man
 y instances\, ludic language use can merely function as momentary pauses i
 nserted in a communicative exchange that pursues different aims. Wordplay 
 thus appears to be a complex phenomenon which is difficult to grasp\, but\
 , at the same time\, it can reveal basic principles of language.\n\nIn a p
 revious conference entitled ''Wordplay and metalinguistic reflection''\, t
 his dimension of wordplay has been addressed in an interdisciplinary persp
 ective. Selected papers of that event will be published in September 2015 
 as the first two volumes of the book series ''The Dynamics of Wordplay'' (
 De Gruyter).\n\nThree years after the first conference\, it is high time t
 o expand the interdisciplinary explorations of wordplay. This is why we wo
 uld like to invite scholars interested in aspects of wordplay to participa
 te with their research in this follow-up conference. The conference aims a
 t studying various facets of the dynamics that become visible in wordplay\
 , unfolding basic principles of language and communication. An important a
 spect concerns the creative dimension of wordplay. As wordplay represents 
 a means of transcending linguistic conventions\, it seems interesting to a
 nalyze the close relations between wordplay and linguistic innovation / ne
 ology. Furthermore\, certain cases of wordplay exhibit a dynamics based on
  contacts between different languages\, cultures and semiotic codes. A thi
 rd way of approaching the phenomenon of wordplay is to study its concrete 
 use in communication and speaker-hearer interaction.\n\nConfirmed Plenary

DESCRIPTION:GermEval 2015: LexSub\n(German Lexical Substitution Shared Tas
 k)\n29 September 2015 at GSCL 2015\, Essen\, Germany\nhttps://sites.google
 .com/site/germeval2015\n\nIntroduction:\n\nWe invite all researchers and i
 ndustry professionals to participate in GermEval 2015: LexSub\, the first 
 lexical substitution task for the German language. The task is associated 
 with the International Conference of the German Society for Computational 
 Linguistics and Language Technology 2015 (GSCL 2015) in Essen\, and will t
 ake place as a workshop there on 29 September 2015.\n\nTask Description:\n
 \nLexical substitution is the task of identifying an appropriate substitut
 e for a target word in a given context. For example\, in the sentence ''Sh
 e's a bright kid who excels academically\,'' an appropriate substitute for
  ''bright'' might be ''smart''\, whereas an inappropriate one would be ''g
 lowing''. Automatically identifying substitution candidates\, and selectin
 g those which best match the context\, requires intelligent application of
  lexical-semantic knowledge and word sense disambiguation techniques. Howe
 ver\, unlike traditional WSD tasks\, lexical substitution does not mandate
  the use of any particular sense inventory.\n\nThe data for the GermEval 2
 015: LexSub task is described by Cholakov et al. in ''Lexical substitution
  dataset for German'' (Proc. LREC\, 2014). All together it consists of 204
 0 sentences from the German Wikipedia\, each containing a target word and 
 a list of substitutions proposed by human annotators.\n\nParticipants need
  not rely on any particular language resources\, but if they wish they can
  employ the sense-linked lexical-semantic resource UBY and JoBimText distr
 ibutional semantics models. UBY also provides an interface to GermaNet. In
 dustrial users will be eligible to a special GermaNet licence to be obtain
 ed from Eberhard-Karls Universität Tübingen. Please refer to our web pag
 es on how to obtain the data sets and resources.\n\nSystems' performance w
 ill be measured by comparing their substitutes against those selected by t
 he human annotators. The organizers will provide a scoring system and the 
 output of some baseline systems.\n\nLocation:\n\nUniversity of Duisburg-Es

DESCRIPTION:Well-functioning terminology management systems are a prerequi
 site for efficient work in terminology for end-users\, content providers a
 nd developers alike. Recently\, there have been several internationally an
 d nationally coordinated efforts to integrate terminological resources on 
 a wide scale. This includes national termbases in several European countri
 es\, terminology portals that provide access to existing termbases distrib
 uted across various organisations\, and cross-national resources such as I
 ATE. Jointly these resources provide better integration\, interoperability
 \, unification and federated access to terminological information. Despite
  significant standardisation in the field of terminology (most notably ISO
  704\, 1087\, 16642\, 26162 and 30042)\, there have been relatively few at
 tempts to coordinate the development of technology needed for terminology 
 management\, including underlying data models developed on the basis of th
 e ISO standards to ensure interoperability and federated access to termino
 logy. So far most projects rely on their own in-house technologies.\n\nThi
 s workshop aims to provide a meeting ground for scholars\, developers and 
 users who take an interest in terminology management systems and will hope
 fully facilitate better integration between various initiatives. We adopt 
 a wide perspective on terminology management systems\, i.e. computer tools
  used to represent and maintain terminological information. This includes 
 not only database systems for registering\, archiving and accessing termin
 ology\, but also a wider set of interconnected tools for exploitation of s
 pecialised corpora\, candidate term extraction and validation of termhood\
 , tools for ontology building and validation\, tools for graphic design\, 
 presentation and visualisation of terminology data and concept hierarchies
 \, tools for intelligent browsing\, tools for user-friendly presentation o
 f content\, etc.

  7 focuses on fundamental elements in understanding the relationship betwe

  or spoken mode of communication. ‘Text’ is meant to be any mode of me
 aning representation such as paintings\, sculptures\, film\, architecture\
 , dance\, music\, etc.\n\nSpecifically\, we may explore questions such as:
 \n\n- What is the relationship between text and the context of situation?\
 n- What can we say about (the context of) culture in relation to text gene
 ration/creation/composition?  And how does the former affect the latter?\n
 - What is the relationship between the context of situation and material s
 ituational setting?\n- How are text structures (or schemata) stored in mem
 ory?\n- How does the retrieval of information from memory create a text?\n
 - What knowledge can be recognised in the psychological process of text ge
 neration/creation/composition and what stimulus retrieves it from memory?\
 n- What neuropsychological processes are involved in text generation/creat
 ion/ composition?

DESCRIPTION:This workshop gathers recent contributions from specialists in
  the compilation and analysis of spoken corpora of Spanish\, Dutch\, Engli

 s perspective. On the one hand\, the talks will tackle the problems derive
 d from the design of the corpus samples and from the compilation and docum
 entation of materials\; on the other hand\, they will also discuss the adv
 antages of developing and using common formats\, resources and technologie
 s. Besides\, these specialists will present new proposals of annotation at
  different levels to properly reflect the typical speech phenomena and to 
 facilitate the study of the relationships among the phonological\, syntact
 ic and pragmatic-discoursive levels of language. From the point of view of
  corpus exploitation and its applications\, we will see how different type
 s of oral corpora provide materials which may be particularly valuable in 
 the areas of second language teaching and learning\, as well as in the res
 earch on dialectal and register variation within a particular language.

SUMMARY:Workshop on the Use of Multilingual Language Resources in Knowledg

DESCRIPTION:A workshop affiliated with the 20th European Symposium on Lang
 uages for Special Purposes (LSP 2015\, https://lsp2015.univie.ac.at/) from
  8-10 July 2015.\n\nAims and Scope:\n\nNowadays the Web is fundamental to 
 any type of professional communication. More and more specialized content 
 is provided in languages other than English. Professional and specialized 
 communication relies on knowledge management systems and language resource
 s\, that is\, collections of natural language data\, such as terminologies
 \, lexicons\, corpora\, NLP resources\, annotation schemes and standards. 
 To meet the challenges of inter- and intra-organizational processes and de
 mands of internationalization\, knowledge representation needs to be multi
 lingual and accessible across systems and platforms.\n\nThe language indus
 try has successfully developed and deployed tools and resources for multil
 ingual content\, such as localization and translation management resources
 \, but its support to knowledge engineering has not yet been sufficiently 
 explored. Multilingual knowledge representation based on web technologies 
 using the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and the Web Ontology Langua
 ge (OWL) is an open research area calling for interdisciplinary approaches
  for creating\, managing\, and using information on the Web.\n\nThe goal o
 f this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners from va
 rious disciplines interested in multilingual knowledge representation and 
 discuss possibilities of leveraging mutual benefits of language and knowle
 dge representation resources. This includes but is not limited to knowledg
 e engineering\, terminology engineering\, ontology-based systems\, lexicog
 raphic approaches\, computational linguistics\, natural language processin
 g and any other context that supports multilingual knowledge representatio
 n methods.

DESCRIPTION:Materialities of the Digital — Open panel at the 4S Annual M
 eeting\n\nMuch popular discourse positions digital technologies as either 
 phantom or prosthetic—presence without substance\, or extension that ena
 bles new experience of the world. Think: Twitter and Google Glass. This ph
 antom/prosthetic dichotomy is a curious one\, one that demands scrutiny an
 d challenge. What are the materialities of the digital? And what do we emb
 race—and hide—when we position them so?\n\nWe investigate materiality 
 broadly here. We include hardware and network materialities such as data c
 enters and undersea cables\, transistors and LCD crystals. Such materialit
 ies are often transmuted by metaphor: the cloud\, the highway\, the screen
 . Why are these materialities treated as elusive? What details are visible
  without this obscuring/illumination?\n\nWe include classic bodily materia
 lities—bodies themselves\, but also physical extension through tactile i
 nterfaces and digital sex toys like RealTouch. What are the material pract
 ices of the digital? How do the shapes of bodies—and selves?—change as
  digital technologies transform boundaries and surroundings? As bodies/obj
 ects cross from one material channel to another?\n\nAnd we include relativ
 e materialities\, such as language and script\, bits and pixels\, avatars 
 and alts. Materialities that arise from their use as building blocks and t
 ools\, from their use as faces and agents that speak and remember. Compone
 nts that undergird everything from affective emoji play to bots that shop 
 the darknet. What does it mean to understand materiality as relative and r
 elational?

DESCRIPTION:More than half of the world's population now lives in cities. 
 Urban areas bring together a great diversity of people\, cultures and styl
 es and constitute the scene of many socio-cultural processes that shape th
 e 21st century. Urban processes are also reflected in the dynamics of lang
 uage variation that exists in today's cities. Language plays an important 
 role in processes of place-making and in the discourse negotiation of urba
 n identities.\n\nGiven this complexity\, the study of transcultural urban 
 spaces requires exchange and cooperation across disciplines. The aim of th
 is conference is thus to connect scholars across various disciplines - par
 ticularly Linguistics and Cultural Geography - that share points of common
  interest and offer the opportunity of fruitful exchange. Offering a platf
 orm for the presentation and discussion of current investigation projects 
 and the exchange of new theoretical and methodological approaches\, the co
 nference seeks to promote new innovative ways to study urban spaces and li
 nguistics from a combined perspective.\n\nKeynote Speakers:\n\n- David Bri

SUMMARY:Translation as a Source of Discovery and Creation
DTSTART;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20160617T000000
DTEND;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20160618T000000
UID:http://linguistlist.org/issues/26/26-1624.html
DESCRIPTION:Translation studies repeatedly examine the sources of translat
 ion. It is less usual\, on the other hand\, to consider translation as a s
 ource\; in other words\, not to review the sources of translation\, but tr
 anslation as a source\, and this will be the subject of the conference.\n\
 nA historical approach will be considered essential\, since from ancient t
 imes translations have been a source of discovery and creation. This diach
 ronic approach will deal for example with texts which have allowed previou
 sly lost or un-deciphered languages and manuscripts to be identified. We c
 an immediately think of the most famous translation of Antiquity\, the Ros
 etta stone\, which enabled Champollion to decipher the hieroglyphics. We c
 an also look into translations of lost texts\; Cicero’s translation of t
 he speeches of Eschine and Demosthenes\, for example\, referred to in othe
 r texts.\n\nIn addition to these instances of discovery or disappearance\,
  we will also note that from ancient times the historical alternation betw
 een literal translation and free translation favoured a still perennial pr
 ocess of creation stemming from the act of translating. Translation in fac
 t is never limited to a simple transposition of literal meanings\, but con
 stitutes a veritable re-creation\, imparting in the literal sense a second
  life to the text\, from which sometimes spring actual descendants in the 
 case of imitations or repeated re-translations of famous works. We will dw
 ell for example on recreations from Roman times\, inspired by renowned Gre
 ek texts\, in an activity of translation-imitation for which authors such 
 as Plautus or Terence have been criticized.  But today we can hardly criti
 cise authors such as Shakespeare\, Molière or La Fontaine for having copi
 ously drawn on ancient sources\, often in fact through translations. \n\nT
 ranslation was also a source of inspiration in more tragic circumstances\,
  characterised by censorship\, and deserves to be recalled in the context 
 of this conference. Under Italian fascism for example\, numerous authors\,
  finding themselves out of work or without a publisher\, resorted to trans
 lation\, initially as a stop-gap measure\, and then as a means of expressi
 on. Reduced to silence\, these authors translated to continue to be heard\
 , while remaining silent about their own works\, which at best they contin
 ued secretly to write. Despite censorship\, translation\, as an alternativ
 e path\, despairingly became a writing source. We will also consider as a 
 source the translation of a text which was never able to be published in i
 ts country and in its native language.\n\nWe will finally study translatio
 n as a source of creation in fields other than literature. In the field of
  the arts for example\, and in particular the artist’s book\, translatio
 n is not only a source of creation but a real experimental tool. In this e
 xperimental zone of new writing which the artist’s book represents\, tra
 nslation is no longer just a conceptual tool\; it becomes a source of crea
 tivity. There are for example several emblematic artist’s books\, such a
 s the “10 premiers nombres classés par ordre alphabétique” by Claude
  Closky\, where the order is inevitably disrupted\, with its transformatio
 n into the English language\, precisely because of its alphabetic classifi
 cation\, thus creating an entirely different work: The First Thousand Numb

DESCRIPTION:The scope and coverage of Applied Linguistics has always been 
 perceived as a way of relating teaching with practical use of the language
 . Among many tendencies in modern education most approaches have been atte
 mpting to bridge the gap between theory and practice. One of the new chall
 enges in the world where the role of languages has become crucial is to di
 scover various ways of creating interaction between knowledge and practice
 . Therefore\, the main theme of LIF2016 is From Theory to Practice: New Di
 rections in ELT and Applied Linguistics. The aim of the conference is to p
 rovide a forum for researchers\, teachers and educational representatives 
 who are interested in the exploration and exchange of theory\, research fi
 ndings\, experience and perspectives in language teaching\, language learn
 ing and language skills development.

SUMMARY:3rd Saarbrücken Conference on Foreign Language Teaching

DESCRIPTION:The Third Saarbrücken Conference on Foreign Language Teaching
  will be held at the Chair of Applied Languages of the Business School of 
 Saarland University of Applied Sciences (Germany). \n\nThe conference feat
 ures the theme: Language Teaching between Aspiration and Reality - Approac
 hes - Methods - Objectives\n\nAbout the Conference Topic:\n\nIn the domain
  of language teaching\, one important objective consists in enabling learn
 ers to adequately master the respective foreign language within a reasonab
 le lapse of time. In doing their utmost to achieve this objective\, resear
 chers and instructors aim at the highest possible efficiency and functiona
 lity of language teaching and language learning. However\, experience show
 s that reality\, i.e. the outcome achieved\, does not always correspond to
  the formers’ aspirations and desires.\n\nWithin this framework\, the fo
 llowing dimensions are of importance:\n- Language instruction at schools a
 nd universities\n- Its various types\n- The preview and review of classes 
 by teachers and students\n- The various forms of teacher training\n- Langu
 age teaching in the context of supplementary adult education\n- Autonomous
  language teaching\, i.e. the various forms of language learning independe
 ntly from any teacher\n- Further forms of language instruction which go be
 yond the framework described above\n\nAll these dimensions of language ins
 truction have the above mentioned objective\, i.e. to lead language learne
 rs to the best possible outcome\, in common\, with aspirations from pupils
 \, students and\, last but not least\, the society as a whole to be respon
 ded to. It is rather rarely observed that language learners obtain a high 
 level of language proficiency up to a (near-)native competence. They may r
 each such a level by means of the methods employed and with the help of th
 eir teachers as well as textbook authors. In the majority of cases\, howev
 er\, learners hardly reach any level above the B1 or B2 bands of the Commo
 n European Framework of Reference for Languages. In these cases\, there ex
 ists a considerable discrepancy between the aspirations of language method
 ology and the hopes it creates on the one hand and the facts of reality on
  the other. This discrepancy represents the overall topic of the Third Saa
 rbrücken Conference on Foreign Language Teaching which will be held from 
 October 29th to 31st\, 2015\, at Saarland University of Applied Sciences i
 n Saarbrücken\, Germany. Researcher\, language instructors and are cordia
 lly invited to participate in this conference.\n\nThe discrepancy between 
 the different aspirations and the reality of language teaching will be exa
 mined with respect to traditional and innovative approaches and methods\, 
 i.e.:\n\n- Linguistics and its (traditional or newly defined) role in lang
 uage teaching\n- The role and importance of methodology in view of the com
 plexity of factors described\n- The language to be taught and its general 
 as well as specific dimensions (i.e. administrative\, legal\, or medical l
 anguage)\n- The role of traditional and new media and the necessity of the
 ir adaptation to reality\n- The role of intercultural differences and conf
 lict\n\nThe Third Saarbrücken Conference of Foreign Language Teaching wil
 l be closely documented on the Internet and is available there under its t
 itle.\n\nRegistrations and submissions of talks can be submitted from the

DESCRIPTION:This half-day event is the third workshop in the series on Def
 initions in Ontologies. The first two such workshops (DO 2013 and IWOOD 20
 14) were held in conjunction with ICBO 2013 and ICBO 2014. This third work
 shop will be held in conjunction with ICBO 2015 in Lisbon\, Portugal\, fro
 m July 27 to 30\, 2015. \n\nDefinitions of terms in ontologies serve a num
 ber of purposes. Logical definitions allow reasoners to assist in the proc
 ess of classification and to verify the results\, thereby lessening the de
 velopment burden. Natural language definitions help ameliorate low inter-a
 nnotator agreement. Good definitions make it possible for non-experts and 
 experts in adjacent disciplines to understand unfamiliar terms\, thereby m
 aking it possible for them to reuse terms in external ontologies. In this 
 way definitions can help to facilitate integration of data.\n\nThe goals o
 f this workshop are: \n\n- to raise awareness of the importance of well-co
 nstructed definitions\; \n- to bring together interested researchers and d
 evelopers to explore issues relating to definitions and enable cross-ferti
 lization leading to new approaches\; \n- to share case studies that expose
  difficulties arising in definition construction\, evaluation\, interpreta
 tion\, and revision\; \n- to encourage evaluation of definitions by reader
 s from different domains in order to surface potential difficulties in int
 erpretation\; \n- to encourage participants to bring practices back to the
 ir projects that benefit the quality of their ontologies.\n\nSee details o

DESCRIPTION:The conference will present the state of the art and original 
 research focused on the use of oral and written interventions aiming\, on 
 the one hand\, to promote narrative\, language and socio-cognitive skills 
 and\, on the other\, to better evaluate these same capacities. Contributio
 ns will concern typically developing children as well as children with lan
 guage and communication disorders.\n\nSeveral studies show that oral narra
 tive skills predict language and early literacy\, and are used often as an
  evaluation tool. The first part of the conference will deal with narrativ
 e activities and will discuss whether and how intervention procedures of d
 ifferent kinds can be used to promote and evaluate children’s narrative\
 , language and socio-cognitive skills.\n\nThe evaluation of language throu
 gh narratives is particularly interesting in language-impaired children. T
 he second part of the conference will discuss how a detailed account of ch
 ildren’s pragmatic and socio-cognitive abilities can provide a better un
 derstanding of the complexity of language disorders. Moreover\, contributi
 ons will emphasize that language-impaired children are not uniformly poor 
 in all domains of language\, but have specific strengths that are best rev
 ealed through oral or written interactions.\n\nFor the preliminary program

DESCRIPTION:The theme this year will be to consider the role of music and 
 songs in the revitalization and preservation of endangered languages. As a
 lways\, FEL invites abstract of papers concerning any language in the worl
 d\, if they address the conference theme. The Conference will be held in N
 ew Orleans\, Louisiana\, USA.\n\nThere are many ways in which the music cu
 lture of endangered language communities is critical to sustaining and rev
 italizing language.\n\nConsider the following four categories:\n\n- Songs 
 are a vehicle for carrying forward the essence of history and culture. The
  repetitive\, structured\, danceable sounds of music are found in almost e
 very society - along with language. What people perform or listen to becom
 es an issue of cultural significance.\n\n- People use language in music to
  re-create and celebrate who they have been and establish what they wish t
 o be.  New words added to an old song look backward to earlier struggles a
 nd makes a statement about the present and future.\n\n- Music is one of th
 e ways that communities establish themselves and try to survive. Endangere
 d peoples and cultures\, not necessarily those in distant forests\, are of
 ten large minority groups within nations that can suddenly erupt into civi
 l war or persecution.\n\n- Speakers of endangered languages can utilize th
 e modern forms of music and musical instruments to make their language rel
 evant\, compatible to other languages and generate interest in their mothe
 r tongue\, both from within the community and from outside.

DESCRIPTION:The languages from the Balto-Slavic group play an important ro
 le due to their diverse cultural heritage and widespread use — with over
  400 million speakers. The recent political and economic developments in C
 entral and Eastern Europe have brought Balto-Slavic societies and their la
 nguages into focus in terms of rapid technological advancement and rapidly
  expanding consumer markets.\n\nResearch on theoretical and applied topics
  in the context of many Balto-Slavic languages is still in its early stage
 s. The linguistic phenomena specific to Balto-Slavic languages — such as
  rich morphological inflection and free word order — make the constructi
 on of NLP tools for these languages a challenging and intriguing task.\n\n
 The goal of this Workshop is to bring together academic researchers and in
 dustry practitioners working on NLP for Balto­-Slavic languages. In parti
 cular\, the Workshop will serve to stimulate the research on NLP technique
 s for Balto­-Slavic languages\, and to foster the creation of tools for t
 hese languages. The Workshop will provide a forum for exchanging ideas and
  experience\, discussing difficult­-to-­tackle problems in this field of
  research\, and making the available resources more widely­ known.\n\nOne
  fascinating aspect of this sub­family of languages is the striking struc
 tural similarity\, as well as an easily recognizable core vocabulary and i
 nflectional inventory spanning the entire group of languages ­­ despite 
 the lack of mutual intelligibility ­­which creates a special environment
 \, in which researchers can fully appreciate the shared problems and solut
 ions and communicate naturally.\n\nThe workshop will consists of: presenta
 tions of accepted papers\, invited talks by prominent researchers in Balto
 ­Slavic NLP\, a  session dedicated to the organisational matters of the r
 ecently\, created ACL Special Interest Group on Slavic Natural Language Pr
 ocessing (SIGSLAV)\, and a discussion on potential shared tasks for Slavic
  languages.\n\nProgramme Committee:\n\nhttp://bsnlp-2015.cs.helsinki.fi/co

DESCRIPTION:In this workshop we seek to highlight the diversity and vitali
 ty of Indigenous languages. ''Language in the Present'' focuses on contemp
 orary expressions of Indigenous languages in conversation\, personal stori
 es\, and song. The aim is to bring together linguists and language activis
 ts to explore the methods\, applications\, and impacts of documenting thes
 e modes of linguistic expression. From the perspective of language activis
 m\, language in its live and lively forms can connect Indigenous people to
  their heritage and their communities. Documenting everyday forms of commu
 nication\, besides supporting language teaching and learning\, reinforces 
 Indigenous languages' enduring relevance in today's world. From a linguist
 's viewpoint\, conversations\, personal stories\, and songs dramatically e
 nrich the record for linguistic analysis and theorizing beyond more usual 
 sources in the formal language of traditional narratives and decontextuali
 zed words or sentences. For all\, the workshop celebrates the centrality o
 f Indigenous vernacular language for sharing life and ways of being in the
  present.\n\nThe workshop will be framed around three panel discussions on
  methods and values in documenting (1) conversation\, (2) personal stories
 \, and (3) song. The list of invited panelists can be found on the worksho
 p website. The workshop will open with a plenary talk by Dr. Larry Kimura 
 of the University of Hawaii Hilo\, and features a presentation by the Firs
 t Peoples' Cultural Council of British Columbia. There will be an evening 
 program celebrating contemporary expression and language in the present\, 
 with performances by Indigenous storytellers and singers.\n\nProceedings f
 rom the workshop will be published as a Special Publication by Language Do
 cumentation and Conservation.

 hology\, while also considering activism in this area. How might we learn 
 from each other to better deconstruct\, comprehend and resist contemporary
  gender ideologies and permutations of sexism?\n \nDuring the day\, we hop
 e to provide a stimulating encounter to collaboratively advance innovative
  interdisciplinary approaches to the complex workings of power and ideolog
 y in discourse\, as well as to reinvigorate intersectional feminist politi
 cs. The invited speakers will be addressing these questions theoretically\
 , empirically\, and/or drawing on their feminist practice/activism\, and t
 here will be opportunities for discussion.\n\nSpeakers:\n\nPaul Baker (Lan

  restricted to\, Arabic\, Bengali\, Berber\, Finnish\, Italian\, Japanese\
 , Saami\, and Swiss German. Yet\, their phonetic manifestation and phonolo

  similarities and differences. For example\, some languages shorten pre‐
 geminate vowels\, whereas other languages lengthen pre‐geminate vowels. 
 The aim of this workshop is to bring together scholars interested in gemin
 ate consonants to discuss a singleton/geminate contrast from multiple pers
 pectives—phonetic\, phonological\, morphological and typological. The wo
 rkshop will consist of two parts: an oral session featuring invited talks 
 and a poster session for which abstracts are solicited from scholars aroun

DESCRIPTION:Bernd Heine (University of Cologne) and Gunther Kaltenböck (U
 niversity of Vienna) are organizing an international workshop on transcate
 goriality at the university of Rouen\, April 27\, 2016.\n\nTranscategorial
 ity in the sense of the term used here concerns doublets of linguistic exp
 ressions belonging each to a different plane of linguistic organization. S
 uch different planes relate on the one hand to the morphosyntactic structu
 re within a sentence\, and on the other hand to the structure of linguisti
 c discourse beyond the sentence (Do-Hurinville\, Dao & Hancil 2015).\n\nTr
 anscategoriality may involve single words\, but it may also involve more c
 omplex forms of linguistic expressions. Morphosyntactic manifestations of 
 it appear to be due mainly to effects of grammaticalization (e.g.\, Robert
  2003). For example\, when a lexical verb gives rise to a marker of tense 
 or aspect\, or an adposition to a conjunction of clause subordination\, th
 e result may be that there are two largely or entirely identical linguisti
 c forms having different functions and belonging to different structures w
 ithin a sentence. Discourse-related manifestations of transcategoriality t
 end to involve cooptation (Kaltenböck et al. 2011) and can be seen\, for 
 example\, in the presence of discourse markers or comment clauses\, which 
 serve the organization of texts and\, hence\, are not strictly a part of s
 entence structure\, but essentially the same expressions can also occur as
  adverbs\, main clauses\, etc. which are part of the structure of a senten
 ce. Questions to be looked into in the workshop include in particular the 
 following:\n\n(1) Is transcategoriality a cross-linguistically significant
  phenomenon?\n(2) What types of it can be distinguished?\n(3) How do sente
 nce-based and discourse-based forms of transcategoriality differ from one 
 another formally and functionally?\n(4) How can transcategoriality be expl
 ained?\n\nReferences:\n\nRobert\, Stéphane 2003. Vers une typologie de la

DESCRIPTION:Held in conjunction with TALN 2015 (22e conférence sur le Tra
 itement Automatique des Langues Naturelles\, Caen\, France\, June\, 22-25 
 2013)\n\nResearch in natural language processing for under-resourced langu
 ages is currently an active area\, in a global perspective of cultural her
 itage preservation. Regional languages generally fall into this category\,
  as electronic resources for these languages are rare and sometimes non-ex
 istent. Providing electronic resources for these languages (including writ
 ten corpora\, lexicons and dictionaries) is a major asset for supporting t
 heir dissemination\, teaching\, preservation or standardization. It is\, a
 mong others\, necessary to develop written corpora\, which are the most re
 presentative of language use\, by collecting written works of various genr
 es (literature\, theater\, poetry\, storytelling\, press ...) and\, for so
 me languages\, by taking variation into account (dialectal\, phonological 
 or graphical variations). The second step is logically to enrich the corpo
 ra with annotations. The development of annotated corpora for regional lan
 guages raises many methodological issues. It is not always possible to dir
 ectly transpose existing models for resource-rich languages\, partly becau
 se of dialectal and phonological variation and the lack of writing standar
 ds. The corpora are also a basis for the development of dictionaries\, lex
 icons and glossaries and are necessary for the description of the actual u
 se of a language. On the other hand\, dictionaries and lexicons are needed
  to support the development of the corpora (optical character recognition\
 , lemmatization and morpho-syntactic analysis). When these resources alrea
 dy exist for a language (dictionaries\, lexicons\, bilingual glossaries co
 upling a regional and a national language)\, the question arises as to how
  information contained in these resources can be shared and possibly be en
 riched with additional annotations (phonetic\, morphosyntactic\, syntactic
 \, ...). Finally\, corpora and lexicons are necessary for the development 
 of natural language processing tools (morpho-syntactic analysis or syntact
 ic analyzers ...).\n\nBeyond the technical and methodological challenges\,
  the more pragmatic difficulties related to the lack of financial and huma
 n resources to carry out the creation of resources should not be neglected
 . This workshop aims to bring together researchers involved in the creatio
 n of language resources and ''basic'' NLP tools for French and European re
 gional languages\, in order to share their views\, methodologies and techn
 iques.

DESCRIPTION:Discourse Relational Devices\n3rd International Conference on 
 Linguistic & Psycholinguistic Approaches to Text Structuring (LPTS 2016)\n
 24-26 January 2016\, Universitat de València (Spain)\n\nAfter a first edi
 tion in Paris in September 2009 and a second edition at the University of 
 Louvain (Louvain-la-Neuve\, Belgium) in 2011\, a third edition of Linguist
 ic & Psycholinguistic Approaches to Text Structuring (LPTS 2016) will take
  place at the University of Valencia (Spain) on January\, 24-26\, 2016.\n\
 nThe aim of the conference is to analyze how discourse relational devices 
 (DRDs) work in oral and written texts. The term 'discourse relational devi
 ces' (DRDs) includes\, but is not limited to\, discourse markers\, and it 
 refers to expressions such as because\, but\, however\, I mean\, well\, fi
 rst\, second\, to take an example or in this line\, that help a speaker st
 ructure and organise discourse. In spite of their universal character and 
 the crucial role they fulfil in the communicative function of language\, t
 heir semantic and pragmatic nature is difficult to grasp\, as may be witne
 ssed by the hundreds of academic studies on DRDs published in the last twe
 nty years on many different languages. An additional is psycholinguistic i
 n nature\, and often takes an experimental approach. This program studies 
 human cognition by investigating the mechanisms underlying discourse coher
 ence\, including the (first language) acquisition and (on-line) processing
  of DRDs and the coherence relations they signal.\n\nKeynote Speakers:\n\n
 - Liesbeth Degand (Université catholique de Louvain) ''Discourse Relation
 al Devices in TextLink: From (categorial) description to corpus annotation
 \, and back again''\n- Kerstin Fischer (University of Southern Denmark) ''
 Discourse markers: definitions and boundaries''\n- Völker Gast ((Universi
 ty of Jena) '''Doing corpus-based typology: Concessivity in a cross-lingui
 stic perspective'''\n- Óscar Loureda (University of Heidelberg) ''Discour
 se markers and Experimental Linguistics''\n\nRegistration:\n\n- Early-Bird
  Fee: 90 EUR\n- Full Conference Fee: 130 EUR\n- Students attending the Tra
 ining School “Methods and Tools for the analysis of discourse relational
  devices” will have a special fee of 50 €.

DESCRIPTION:The fourth edition of the ‘Formal and Experimental Advances 
 in Sign Language Theory’ (FEAST) conference will take place at Pompeu Fa
 bra University (Barcelona) on May 4-6\, 2015. FEAST is the conference of t
 he COST Action IS1006 ‘Unraveling the grammars of European sign language
 s: pathways to full citizenship of deaf signers and to the protection of t
 heir linguistic heritage’ (signgram.eu). FEAST is a regular forum to dis
 cuss formal approaches to sign language grammar\, experimental approaches 
 to sign languages\, and their interaction. For information about this COST
  Action visit: signgram.eu.\n\nFEAST is a regular forum to discuss formal 
 approaches to sign language grammar (in particular in the generative tradi
 tion)\, experimental approaches to sign languages\, and their interaction.
 \n\nThe keynote speakers at the main session (May 4-5) of the FEAST 2015 B
 arcelona will be:\n\nDiane Lillo-Martin (University of Connecticut\, USA)\

 n\nOn May 6 there will be an outreach session featuring a presentation of 
 the final product of the Action (The SignGram Blueprint\, a guide to the p
 reparation of comprehensive reference grammars for sign languages) and a d
 iscussion panel on the impact of linguistic research for sign language com
 munities and Deaf signers (education\, interpretation\, acquisition\, lang
 uage deficits\, language policies). This session will be attended by diffe
 rent stakeholders\, such as representatives of Deaf communities\, associat
 ions of sign language interpreters\, and language policy-makers.\n\nThe sp
 eakers at the outreach session will be:\n\nBenjamin Bahan (Gallaudet Unive
 rsity\, USA)\nDiane Lillo-Martin (University of Connecticut\, USA)\nJosep 
 Quer (ICREA-Universitat Pompeu Fabra) & Carlo Cecchetto (Università degli

SUMMARY:Workshop on Varieties of Adjectival Modification

DESCRIPTION:This workshop on “Varieties of Adjectival Modification” is
  to be held at Zhejiang University\, China on 17-18 October\, 2015. It is 
 devoted to the exploration of various non-canonical adjectival modificatio
 n relations at the interface of syntax and semantics. Since Montague (1970
 )\, adjective meanings are analyzed as functions from properties to proper
 ties. This argument can be maintained in canonical cases like “a carnivo
 rous animal”\, but the complexity of adjectival modification goes far be
 yond that. The complexity of adjectival modification relations is manifest
 ed at least in the following aspects:  \n\n- Adjectives may occur at vario
 us syntactic positions\, including the adnominal position\, the predicate 
 position\, and the \nposition before classifiers (Jackendoff 1977: a delic
 ious cup of coffee) and on the left-periphery of DP etc.\; \n- A variety o
 f adjectives can be distinguished based on their lexical meanings\, such a
 s privative adjectives (Partee 1995)\, \nadnominal degree adjectives (Morz
 ycki 2012)\, numerical adjectives (Rothstein 2010\, 2012\, Nouwen 2010\, 2
 014)\, expressive \nadjectives (Gutzmann 2012\, Potts 2007)\, multidimensi
 onal adjectives (Sassoon 2007)\; \n- Adjectives may modify various types o
 f nouns\, such as gradable nouns (Morzycki 2009: a big idiot)\, event noun
 s (Larson 1995: a beautiful dancer) etc.   \n\nInvited Speakers: \n\nSusan

SUMMARY:States and Events

DTEND;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20150418T000000

DESCRIPTION:Davidson’s (1967) proposal to augment the argument structure
  of ‘action’ verbs with an event argument has proven to be very useful
  in explicating the meaning of verbal predicates\, especially in the relat
 ionship between meaning to syntactic structure\, and has enabled a treatme
 nt of adverbial modification\, foremost manner modification\, in terms of 
 intersective event modification. The Neo-Davidsonian suggestion to introdu
 ce something like an event argument also for states and even for non-verba
 l predicates (e.g. Higginbotham 1985\, Parsons 1990\, Landman 2000) has be
 en met with more resistance. One of the reasons for treating states differ
 ently\, for example\, is that they are commonly incompatible with manner m
 odification (cf. Katz’s 2003 Stative Adverb Gap\; see also Maienborn 200
 3 et seq.\, Katz 2008). Others have argued that there is no typological di
 fference between states and events\, but states are conceptually ‘poorer
 ’ and thus compatible with fewer adverbs (e.g. Mittwoch 2005\, Geuder 20
 06\, Ernst 2011). Yet others have called into question some of the empiric
 al basis for making such a clear-cut distinction between events and states
  (e.g. Rothstein 2005) or proposed a broader definition of the notion of e
 vent\, to also include states (e.g. Ramchand 2005). Husband (2012) and Roy
  (2014) have attributed properties of certain statives to internal concept
 ual structure of the states they refer to. Finally\, research in processin
 g suggests that eventualities more generally can differ in structural comp
 lexity (e.g. McKoon and MacFarland 2000\, 2002\, Gennari and Poeppel 2003\
 , Mobayyen and de Almeida 2005).\n\nGeneral questions to be addressed at t
 his workshop include the following: What is a state? How do states relate 
 to events? Is the notion of “state” a primitive notion in an event ont
 ology\, or if (some) states have internal complexity\, how so? Do states m
 ake available an event argument? How are stative predicates to be represen
 ted at the interface with syntax\, recognizing that the compositional hypo
 thesis is to date much more fleshed-out for events than for states? Does b
 oundedness play a role at the level of grammar in distinguishing eventive 
 from stative predicates\, in\, e.g\, nominalizations? The notion of bounde
 dness may be intuitively clear but it has been characterized in several wa
 ys and can encompass forms of telicity and perfectivity (e.g. Krifka 1998\
 , Borik 2006). Are there more fine-grained ontological distinctions\, perh
 aps related to causation\, that are relevant to answering the above questi
 ons? Is there psycholinguistic evidence in favor of a clear distinction be
 tween states and events?\n\nIn addition\, the literature identifies distin
 ctions between different kinds of states\, including:\n\n- Dynamic vs. sta
 tic (e.g. Bach 1981\, 1986\; Dowty 1979)\n- Davidsonian vs. Kimian (Maienb
 orn 2003 et seq.\; see also Rothmayr 2006\, Marín 2013)\n- Inchoative sta
 tes (e.g. de Swart 1998\, Marín & McNally 2011)\n- Lexical vs. derived (c
 f. Gehrke 2011 et seq.\, Fábregas & Marín 2012)\n- Individual vs. stage-
 level (Carlson 1977\, Milsark 1974)\n\nAre all of these distinctions neede
 d? If so\, what is the empirical basis for each distinction? How are they 
 to be represented? How does any one distinction relate to other distinctio
 ns made among states? Are there distinctions that apply to events as well 
 as to states?\n\nThis workshop will feature talks addressing such question
 s. We are particularly interested in talks that relate notions of stativit
 y to notions of eventivity.\n\nInvited Speakers:\n\nAshwini Deo (Yale Univ

DESCRIPTION:La journée d’études Mobilité\, migrations\, réseaux\, qu
 i se tiendra à l’Université de Paris-Ouest le 16 juin 2015\, se donne 
 pour objectif de mieux prendre en compte le rôle que jouent les réseaux 
 sociaux dans les pratiques linguistiques\, avec certains effets plus ou mo
 ins directs de mobilités. A ce titre\, elle prend pour point nodal les pr
 atiques langagières des locuteurs (et de leurs trajets\, individuels ou c
 ollectifs)\, plus que les effets sur les systèmes linguistiques.\n\nArgum
 entaire de la Journée :\n\nLa mobilité de populations et de leurs façon
 s de parler ne se présente pas comme une nouveauté\, qui serait un actue
 l sous-produit de la globalisation\, même si la période moderne a certai
 nement participé d’une démultiplication/accélération des processus d
 e mobilité et de migrations (le nombre de migrants a en effet triplé dan
 s les 40 dernières années à travers le monde).\n\nLes 8 exposés de la 
 journée (parmi lesquels 2 exposés de thésards) seront centrés sur des 
 questions de langue\, de cultures et d’identités\, en les ancrant dans 
 des facteurs historiques\, sociologiques\, voire géo-politiques\, avec po
 ur point commun de porter sur le français. Cette journée s’inscrit dan
 s le cadre global du GTRC canadien Le français à la mesure d’un contin
 ent\, en soulevant des questions autour des effets linguistiques et langag
 iers des mobilités\, migrations\, déplacements de population ainsi que l
 eurs effets à plus ou moins longue échéance. Elle vise ainsi des probl
 ématiques générales\, en particulier autour de ce qui peut être tiré 
 de la notion de réseaux (quelle qu’en soit la modalité\, sociale ou nu
 mérique).

  in Linguistics worldwide.\n\nΑs mentioned above\, this is the 8th bienni
 al consecutive conference\, a well-established tradition\, among postgradu
 ate and PhD students\, of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athe
 ns. \n\nIt is an effort of the Faculty’s postgraduate students to give t
 he opportunity to their colleagues from Greece\, Europe or elsewhere to pr
 esent their work and meet other fellow colleagues. Thus\, PhD candidates c
 ould receive constructive feedback regarding their research while postgrad
 uate students get the opportunity to present their research in a friendly 
 environment while enhancing their skills in the presentation of their work
 . \n\nMoreover\, the major benefit for all the Conference participants is 
 that we all get a chance to interact with the current international resear
 ch trends\, since it is us shaping these trends.\n\nThe main sections of t
 his conference are\, namely: \n\n- Byzantine Philology \n- Classical Philo
 logy \n- Folkloristics \n- Linguistics\n- Medieval and Modern Greek Philol
 ogy \n\nEach department had specified the modules of each field in advance
  in order for the research range to be reduced.\n\nPlease note that all po
 stgraduate students who are registered in a Master's program or a PhD have
  the opportunity to participate in this conference.

DESCRIPTION:The Centre for the Greek Language is organizing a conference o
 n Ancient Greek Dialects. The emphasis of the conference is on the linguis
 tic map of Central and Northern Greece in antiquity (from the beginnings u
 p to the Roman period). More specifically\, the focus of the conference is
  on the dialect map of Central and Northern Greece\, i.e. Thessaly\, Boeot
 ia\, Aetolia\, Epirus\, Macedonia\, Thrace\, and the islands of Northern A
 egean along with the coast of Asia Minor and the Black Sea. The papers dea
 l with all aspects of the linguistic make-up of the area under investigati
 on (various phonological issues\, morphological problems\, and syntactic p
 henomena) and with all types of evidence: epigraphic\, textual\, lexicogra
 phical\, onomastics and other information that attest to the linguistic ma
 p of the area\, as well as intra-dialect variations and/or sub-divisions\,
  and relations of Greek to other languages of the wider vicinity\, such as
  the ancient Balkan languages. A number of papers take a comparative view 
 as to the way the various dialects interact with one another\, whereas oth
 er participants take a sociolinguistic approach to the dialects investigat
 ed\, the various strata and/or substrata observed\, the dialectal and/or l
 anguage admixture\, dialect continuum\, etc.\n\nOrganizing Committee:\n\nA

SUMMARY:Questions\, Answers and Negation

DTEND;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20160122T000000

DESCRIPTION:The presence of negation in an utterance can have interpretati
 ve effects for which it has been surprisingly hard to make precise empiric
 al generalizations. Prominent contexts where this happens are negative pol
 ar questions and dialogues where a simple 'yes' or 'no' is used as a reply
  to a negative question or assertion. In polar questions\, the presence of
  a negation may signal that the speaker's expectation with respect to the 
 state-of-affairs asked about is biased towards a positive or a negative an
 swer. The particular bias is assumed to depend inter alia on the syntactic
  position of the negative marker\, the prosody of the question and the con
 text\, but the empirical generalizations are still controversial. In dialo
 gues\, the use of 'yes' or 'no' has been claimed to be ambiguous if uttere
 d as a reply to a negative question or assertion. There are indications fo
 r subtle preferences\, which depend on the syntax\, the prosody and the co
 ntext - and which are largely unexplored.\n\nTheoretical analyses of the m
 eaning of 'yes' and 'no' responses are (a) semantic-pragmatic accounts whe
 re the particles are analysed in terms of anaphoricity\, e.g. with positiv
 e or negative propositions serving as anaphors\, or (b) syntactic accounts
 \, where the particles are assumed to be remnants in an otherwise elided c
 lause. Analyses of polar question bias (a) assign a special pragmatic stat
 us to the proposition in the sentence radical of the question\, (b) derive
  the bias from the interaction of negation and a VERUM operator scoping ov
 er the positive proposition\, or (c) explain the observed data patterns in
  terms of speech acts and negation operating on the sentence radical. Thus
  in the semantic-pragmatic accounts of both types of phenomena\, an import
 ant role is assigned to the positive proposition that the negation scopes 
 over.\n\nThe positive proposition also has been claimed to play an importa
 nt role during the processing of negative declarative sentences\, which le
 ad to increased processing costs in comparison to positive declarative sen
 tences. Negative sentences are thought to effect two mental simulations in
  the mental representation of discourses: one for the expected states-of-a
 ffairs\, which is denoted by the (positive) proposition without the negati
 on operator\, and one for the actual states-of-affairs. However\, again se
 veral issues are still unresolved\, for instance (1) whether comprehenders
  indeed routinely represent the expected states-of-affairs during comprehe
 nsion or whether there are certain conditions under which comprehenders di
 rectly represent the actual state of affairs\, and (2) whether\, and if so
  at what point in the comprehension process\, comprehenders evaluate the e
 xpected state of affairs against their general world knowledge and its fit
  with the linguistic and extra-linguistic utterance context.\n\nThe presen
 t workshop aims at gaining a better understanding of the role of negation 
 in questions and in assertions from an empirical\, a theoretical-linguisti
 c and a processing point-of-view. Its goal is to bring together research o
 n the influence of syntactic\, prosodic and contextual factors on question
  bias\, on response strategies and on the processing of negative sentences
 . We particularly welcome contributions that combine quantitative empirica
 l research with rigorous theoretical analyses.\n\nInvited Speakers:\n\nMan

DESCRIPTION:Situated at the peripheries of the world’s two most populous
  nation-states - India and China - the Himalayan region represents an exce
 ptional site for the study of the intersection of language\, ethnic and na
 tional politics. As the Himalayas are home to both contested ethno-nationa
 lisms and disputed and shifting borders\, language often finds itself not 
 only at the forefront of the region’s cultural politics\, but also its g
 eopolitics. Fredrik Barth’s Ethnic Groups and Boundaries (1969) signifie
 d a major shift in the approach to the study of ethnic groups. Barth argue
 d that\, if we focus on boundaries\, we can see that the forms ethnicity t
 akes are relational - it is the boundary\, in fact\, which makes salient t
 he cultural content of ethnic groups. This conference engages with and uti
 lizes Barth’s early insights to investigate the role of language in boun
 dary maintenance among Himalayan peoples. We seek to emphasize ethnicity\,
  culture\, and nationalism as products of this on-going boundary maintenan
 ce. Thus\, in this conference\, we ask: What roles do languages play in th
 e production of Himalayan ethnicities and nationalisms? \n\nThis workshop-
 style conference is not only for those who are interested in the Himalayan
  or South Asian regions\, but those who have a theoretical interest in lan
 guage politics\, the role of languages in the making of ethnic groups and 
 national polities\, and the study of borders and boundaries.

SUMMARY:22nd LIPP Symposium: Text-World-Models - Cognitive Text Linguistic

DESCRIPTION:In recent decades\, the belief that general cognitive and sens
 omotoric capabilities affect the language faculty as essential determinant
 s has grown increasingly prevalent in linguistics. After the initial main 
 focus on lexical units (as in cognitive semantics)\, linguists began explo
 ring other aspects of language and speech acts from a cognitive perspectiv
 e - from cognitive grammar and construction grammar to interpretation of '
 texts' in terms of cognitive text linguistics. This concerns not only cogn
 itive processes underlying text production and their linguistic manifestat
 ions\, but also conventionalized knowledge activated through 'text types' 
 and the corresponding processing mechanisms. In this sense\, texts can als
 o be understood as 'symbolic forms' that embody relevant cognitive models.
 \n\nThe 22nd LIPP-symposium\, focussing on aspects within this paradigm\, 
 will discuss new research approaches in the field of cognitive text lingui
 stics. The title 'Text - World - Models' addresses three essential compone
 nts of this field of text linguistics: 'texts' as internally structured\, 
 more or less distinctive symbolic units\, 'cognitive models' as schematize
 d knowledge structures reflected and represented in text types\, and 'worl
 d(s)' as a basis for the cognitive\, cultural and praxeological categoriza
 tion of knowledge.\n\nThe 22nd LIPP-symposium is organised by doctoral stu
 dents of the Graduate School of Language & Literatur Munich - Class of Lan
 guage. The symposium will discuss new research approaches in the field of 
 cognitive text linguistics.\n\nKeynote Speakers (confirmed):\n\n- Prof. Dr

DESCRIPTION:With an ever-increasing number of cross-cultural interactions 
 both in the world of academia and in the workplace\, understanding the imp
 act of culture on human interactions is becoming critical for effective ac
 ademic and corporate communication to occur. The premise underlying the co
 nference theme is that cultures provide preferred ways for people to organ
 ize and communicate their thoughts depending on forms of discourse and on 
 face systems they participate in. Consistent with cultural variation in co
 mmunication behavior\, business negotiations also feature differences in p
 ersuasion and negotiation styles\, and in conflict resolution techniques.\
 n\nThe lack of definitive research in this area suggests many new avenues 
 for future research within the field of intercultural communication\, with
  particular reference to the context of cross-cultural discourse\, busines
 s and cultural studies.\n\nConference Goals:\n\n- To foster interdisciplin
 ary dialogues for developing unified approaches to complex problems of com
 munication across cultures\n- To build bridges between the academic and co
 rporate worlds\n- To advance the methodology for intercultural studies\n- 
 To integrate research perspectives and practice in the fields of discourse
  studies\, textual linguistics\, business and cultural studies as well as 
 foreign language teaching\n- To provide insight into pedagogical approache

DESCRIPTION:Learning the correct pronunciation of a second language (L2) u
 sually requires continual practice supervised by a teacher providing feedb
 ack on particular problems and\, ideally\, intensive interaction with nati
 ve speakers. But very often\, the tight schedule in L2 classrooms does not
  leave room for this time-consuming training. Computer-assisted pronunciat
 ion training (CAPT) systems seem to be a promising complement or alternati
 ve\, giving students the possibility to practice oral skills and concentra
 te on specific problems\, receive feedback on their pronunciation and list
 ening skills\, and work on problems in a self-determined pace. \n\nThis tw
 o-day workshop aims to bring together data-driven and experimental researc
 h lines and provide an exchange forum for discussions in order to gain a b
 etter understanding of the role of feedback in pronunciation training with
  a focus on CAPT. The workshop will consist of invited talks\, oral presen
 tations of ongoing research and discussion papers as well as an evaluation
  of current commercial CAPT systems. \n\nThe invited speakers are:\n\n- Ca
 tia Cucchiarini (Centre for Language and Speech Technology\, Radboud Unive
 rsity Nijmegen) – \nComputer-assisted pronunciation training\n- Daniel H
 irst (CNRS Laboratoire Parole et Langage\, Université de Provence) – \n
 Manipulation and transplantation of prosody \n- Anne Hecksteden (Institute

DESCRIPTION:Multilingualism in early childhood education is under-investig
 ated\, nevertheless researchers with an interest in this area of childhood
  development are beginning to publish\, network and share their interest. 
 With a view to supporting this emerging field and creating a bridge betwee
 n the disciplines of early childhood education and language education\, th
 is international research conference focuses on the development of two or 
 more languages in the home or at school by children from birth to 6 years 
 old – the conference aims to focus on research into aspects of L1 and L2
  language development in contexts of awareness of languages\, additional l
 anguages\, foreign languages\, second languages\, bilingual education and 
 immersion. \n\nAimed at scholars and PhD students investigating the field 
 and practitioners involved in research e.g. action research\, presentation
 s will provide a meaningful forum for debate and collaboration between nov
 ice and experienced researchers. The conference organizers expect to recei
 ve papers from research into childhood multilingualism in educational cont
 exts from around the world.\n\nOrganized around a format that allows for p
 articipants to engage in discussion\, presentations will be for 30 minutes
  with a 10-minute question time and grouped around commonalities. The obje
 ctive will be to provide participants with the opportunity to build a coll
 ective understanding of issues with opportunities to reflect upon and deba
 te common concerns as well as contribute to theory building in relation to
  multilingualism in early childhood education.\n\nPlenary Speakers:\n\nPro

DESCRIPTION:The ''Corpus-based Research in the Humanities'' workshop (CRH)
  continues the series of workshops previously named ''Annotation of Corpor

 d\, respectively in 2011 (Heidelberg\, Germany)\, 2012 (Lisbon\, Portugal)
  and 2013 (Sofia\, Bulgaria).\n\nCRH wants to be a meeting place for both 
 scholars from Computational Linguistics and from the Humanities (especiall
 y\, Digital Humanities). Although the two research areas share a number of
  common topics\, there is still limited collaboration between the two comm
 unities. Since the empirical evidence provided by corpora plays a central 
 role in both disciplines\, we believe that a workshop focussed on the diff
 erent uses of (different kinds of) corpus data in the Humanities might rep
 resent a valid opportunity to make the two communities meet\, discuss and 
 compare their interests\, methods and aims.

DESCRIPTION:In the last 10-15 years\, research on sign languages has shown
  an increasing interest in nonmanual articulators. Nonmanuals express a va
 riety of important linguistic functions and they play a crucial role at al
 l levels of the grammar of sign languages: sign languages use lexical faci
 al expressions\, various kinds of morphosyntactic nonmanual markers as wel
 l as nonmanuals expressing prosodic and semantic-pragmatic functions. Ling
 uistic nonmanual markers typically develop from nonmanual gestures used in
  hearing and deaf communities. The visual-manual modality of sign language
 s offers the unique possibility of integrating and grammaticalizing nonman
 ual and manual gestures since gestures use the same articulatory channel t
 hat is also active in the production of signs. By contrast\, nonmanuals in
  spoken languages can only be used as co-speech gestures. \n\nThe language
 s of the workshop are English and ASL. Interpretation between English and 
 ASL will be provided. \n\nInvited Speakers:\n\nDiane Brentari (Chicago\, U

 es correspondent member\, Professor Vladimir M. Alpatov.\nMoscow\, April 2
 2-23\, 2015.\n\nThe conference is dedicated to the 70th birthday of the em
 inent Russian linguist\, Professor Vladimir Mikhailovitch Alpatov. The cel
 ebration is gladly shared by two institutions: the RAS Institute of Orient
 al Studies\, where Professor Alpatov has been carrying out his scientific 
 activities since 1971\, and the RAS Institute of Linguistics that he has b
 een successfully guiding as Director since 2012. Professor Alpatov is univ
 ersally known for his encyclopedic mind and varied spheres of research int
 erest. He has gained respect and general recognition due to his numerous w
 orks on Japanese (including phonetics\, morphology\, syntax of this langua
 ge as well as the study of general grammar categories)\, Altaic languages\
 , general linguistics (the problem of word\, theory of the parts of speech
 \, etc.)\, sociolinguistics\, typology\, theory and history of linguistics
 .\n\nProfessor Alpatov is known to be the first to use methodologically re
 levant differentiation of anthropocentric and systemocentric approaches in
  linguistics\, thus elaborating a new trend in systematizing linguistic kn
 owledge. His contribution to grammar studies (both general and Japanese)\,
  sociolinguistics and language policy\, history of linguistics and other b
 ranches is known as tremendous.\n\nDiscussions are organized within the fo
 llowing panels:\n\n- History of linguistics and linguists. Historical and 
 cultural stereotypes in comparative linguistics.\n- Sociolinguistics. Lang
 uages used in Russia and neighbouring countries. The legislative aspect of
  language policy in respect of languages spoken in Russia and China\, etc.
 \n- Theory and methods of linguistics. Anthropocentric and systemocentric 
 approaches to analysis.\n- Sociolinguistics. Cross-cultural and cross-ling
 uistic analysis (lexical and syntactic semantics of Bulgarian Muslim Gypsi
 es speaking a Balkan dialect of Turkish\; the dialect system of Tibetan\; 
 a new overview of languages spoken in India\, etc.)\n- Studies held on par
 ticular language levels. Morphology of the parts of speech.\n- Syntax stud
 ies.\n- Japan and the Japanese language (symbolic meaning of colour and co
 lor stereotypes in Japan\; colour nominations in Old Japanese\, etc.)\n- S
 tudies in the fields of phonetics\, graphics\, vocabulary and lexical sema
 ntics.\n- Teaching Japanese and other languages (Prof. Alpatov’s researc
 h in teaching Japanese and cross-cultural communication\, etc.)\n- Lexicog
 raphy studies.\n- Politeness and pragmatics (matrix representation of Japa
 nese polite forms represented in Prof. V. Alpatov’s research as an analy
 tical basis of possible parametrisation of speech etiquette in Slavic lang
 uages\; frame structure of the speech act of volition\, etc).\n\nThe Russi

DESCRIPTION:Due to internal infrastructural complications and five fairs t
 o be held in Dusseldorf in the week of June 18 and 19\, the workshop has b
 een rescheduled. The new dates for the workshop are June 25 and 26. Other 
 than that\, nothing changed.\n\nThis workshop aims at analyzing emotion co
 ncepts from an interdisciplinary perspective (linguistics\, philosophy\, p
 sychology). On the one hand\, the workshop is interested in the cognitive 
 mechanisms underlying the experience of emotions and emotion concepts\, an
 d\, on the other hand\, it is interested\nin the (frame-theoretical) model
 ing and prediction of the ways in which emotion expressions are used.\n\nA
  core feature of human mental life is not only the experience of emotion b
 ut also the application of emotion concepts to the outer world. We do not 
 only know what it is like to be surprised\, but we also describe a situati
 on or an event as surprising or even call something a 'surprise'. On the c
 ontrary\, we might consider a situation to be sad\, but we would not label
  it by the word 'sadness' (in English\, at least).\n\nMoreover\, it is not
  only the case that we apply emotion concepts such as SAD and JOYFUL to in
 animate subjects as music\, art and literature (e.g.\, this song is so sad
 \, this melody is so joyful\, this story has a happy ending)\, but we also
  use emotion concepts to intensify our emotions when we speak\,\nfor examp
 le\, about panic-stricken fear.\nInvited Speakers::\n\nMargaret Freeman (M

 hill et al. 2008\, Moran et al 2014\, Dryer & Haspelmath 2013\,Wichmann et
  al. 2013).  These data can be profitably exploited computationally to exp
 lore linguistic history and linguistic universals. Work in Bioinformatics 
 has addressed parallel sets of questions for data on living species and a 
 large array of computational modeling and techniques have been developed t
 owards this goal (Felsenstein 2004). The workshop aims to bring together l
 inguists\, biologists and mathematicians to make theoretical and empirical
  progress in the area of computational modeling of linguistic data for his

DESCRIPTION:« Jeux en jeu dans l’enseignement/apprentissage des langues
  en Lansad »\n\nPlaying roles: what are the stakes in LSP / LAP?\n\nIn hi
 s work entitled L’anthropologie du geste\, Marcel Jousse describes man a
 s an \n“interactional mimic” ([1974] 2008) who cannot but replay the a
 ctions he sees \naround himself\, actions which imprint upon him and which
  he expresses through replaying \nthem. Man thus constructs his identity\,
  his role by replaying the actions he \nsees around him. Playing roles all
 ows him to “become the other” and by so doing\, to \nunderstand and me
 morise better (Lecoq 1997). As a result\, the act of playing \n(and replay
 ing) a role allows the acquisition of skills and knowledge by bonding with
  others\, \nbecause playing requires recognising and adapting to the other
 ’s needs. \nFinally\, playing is a creative process\, because replaying 
 is never a simple repetition or \nholding up of a mirror\, but it is a per
 sonal and dynamic reaction. It is not a \ncase of a figurative representat
 ion of that which we observe and replay\, but an acting out of \nits essen
 ce – a dynamic activity. \n\nIn this way\, playing roles can be a fun an
  entertaining activity which we could encourage \nour students to engage i
 n in order to motivate them\; it remains however a \nbehaviour which is in
 nate\, which is “profoundly anthropological” (ibid). In a similar vein
 \, \nBerthoz considers that there can be no learning without action becaus
 e “the \norigin of thought resides in the necessity of movement” (2009
 ). Other researchers in \nneuroscience have underlined the importance of t
 he body in learning\, such as \nRizzolatti\, who suggests the existence of
  mirror neurons which allow us to unconsciously \nimitate the actions of o
 thers. \n\nThe links between play and learning are numerous - both are emi
 nently social phenomena \nwhich re-place the individual in his or her envi
 ronment. They allow the re-\npresentation of his or her identity and reinf
 orce the role of the body in understanding \nothers. Play remains marginal
 ised however in the language classroom (Lapaire \n& Masse 2008\; Aden 2008
 ). How\, under these conditions\, should we envisage teaching & \nlearning
  LSP / LAP so as to give playing its due? This is the question \nwhich we 
 will try to address at the next APLIUT conference in Lyon. The notion of p
 laying \nroles can be approached from a number of angles (theatre\, strate
 gy \ngames\, video games\, physical games\, etc.) as well as its implicati
 ons in terms of teaching \nand learning languages (motivation\, pleasure\,
  autonomy\, memorisation\, \netc.)\n\nReferences\nAden J. 2008. « Compét

 electronic resources\, and in particular of syntactically parsed corpora\,
  in research on language change. We welcome proposals addressing diachroni

 n achieving meaningful results. \n\nMotivation and Aims:\n\nOver the last 
 two decades\, treebanks have become an increasingly useful instrument for 
 data-driven study of linguistic structures at various levels. The prolifer
 ation of treebanks has led to a very large number of resources available f
 or different languages\, which can support comparative research of various
  issues cross-linguistically. In recent years\, a growing number of treeba
 nks has also become available for ancient languages and for different hist
 orical stages of the same language: the York-Toronto-Helsinki corpus (http
 ://www-users.york.ac.uk/~lang22/YcoeHome1.htm) and the Penn Corpora of His
 torical English (https://www.ling.upenn.edu/hist-corpora/) for English\, T

 sian\, PROIEL (http://www.hf.uio.no/ifikk/english/research/projects/proiel
 /) for various ancient Indo-European languages and recently extended to ho
 st treebanks for medieval stages of Romance and Germanic languages\, Perse
 us Latin and Ancient Greek Dependency Treebanks (http://nlp.perseus.tufts.
 edu/syntax/treebank/) for Latin and Ancient Greek\, the Index Thomisticus 
 Treebank (http://itreebank.marginalia.it) for Latin\, and several others. 
 This allows data extraction aimed to assessing the scope and the effects o
 f diachronic developments\, managing a large amount of data and retrieving
  information whose relevance can then be evaluated through statistical met
 hods. Possible issues that can be tackled through diachronic treebanks are
  potentially numerous and of different nature\, and include increasing or 
 decreasing productivity of syntactic or morphological constructions\, and\
 , most interesting\, interrelationships between different changes that hav
 e previously been considered unrelated or whose interrelation is otherwise
  hard to prove.

DESCRIPTION:The conference ''Cognitive Modeling in Linguistics'' has its h
 istory since 1998 when it started as a conference in ''Cognitive Modeling'
 ' later specified as ''Cognitive Modeling in Linguistics'' (CML). In 1998 
 and 2000 the CML conferences were part of the Russian National Conference 
 on Artificial Intelligence (CAI)\, and later - of the International Congre
 ss on Artificial Intelligence (ICAI-2001 and IEEE International Conference
  ''Artificial Intelligence Systems'' (IEEE AIS'02)\, both took place in Di
 vnomorskoe (Russia).\n\nThe following CML conferences were held in: CMLs f
 rom 2003 to 2007 - Bulgaria (Varna and Sofia)\; CML-2008 - Bechichi\, Mont
 enegro\; CML-2009 - Constanza\, Romania\; CML-2010 - Dubrovnik\, Croatia\;
  CML-2011 - Corfu\, Greece. The XIV-th Conference CML-2013 in Milano Marit
 tima was conducted in a new format - as part of the 1st International Foru
 m that significantly expanded the subject of Cognitive Modeling. It was he
 ld simultaneously with the 1-st International Conference ''Cognitive Model
 ing in Science\, Culture and Education» (CMSCE-2013). This integrated for
 um appeared constructive and successful taking into account the interdisci
 plinary character of the domain and the importance of the exchange of theo
 retical ideas and experience of researchers from different topics. \n\nThe
  forum on cognitive modeling in the sub-domains of both conferences gave r
 ise to further international cooperation in science and technologies deali
 ng with cognitive approaches. The Third International Forum on Cognitive m
 odeling (IFCM-2015) and its 2 conferences - the XV-th Anniversary Conferen
 ce ''CML-2014'' and the II-nd International Scientific Conference “CMSCE
 -2014” - in Slovenia in September 2014\, were attended by 90 scientists 
 from 9 countries.\n\nFor more detailed information\, see the website: www.
 confcognresearch.ru\n\nThe Third Forum on Cognitive Modeling IFCM-2015 and
  its 2 conferences will be held on 14- 21 September in Bulgaria\, the Blac
 k Sea coast\, in the city of Varna. Plenary sessions of both conferences a
 re held conjointly\; sections and seminars work separately\, taking into a
 ccount the specificity of their subject.

 ar as information technology and language technology are concerned. Many o
 f these languages are also still underdescribed and are threatened by larg
 er and more powerful languages. Most of them are included in the UNESCO At
 las of Endangered Languages with critical degrees of endangerment\, in som
 e cases despite their official status.\n\nDocumentary Linguistics has deve
 loped as a response to the urgent task of documenting and supporting endan
 gered languages. Recent advances in the development of computational tools
  have given linguists many new possibilities for language research which c
 an also be adapted to the every-day needs of language communities. Ideally
 \, this should lead to close interaction between the processes of language
  documentation on the one hand and developing or adapting language technol
 ogy for endangered languages on the other. The outcomes of linguistic docu
 mentation are used to serve both linguists and language communities. Langu
 age technology can be regarded as the next level in making a language more
  stable and prestigious for its speakers and their neighbours.\n\nThe conf
 erence aims at bringing together researchers from different countries who 
 work on language documentation and/or developing and adapting language tec
 hnologies \, especially for endangered languages. In particular we invite 
 papers exploring methodological and technical issues of documenting langua
 ges and developing language technologies for North-East Asian languages\, 
 as well as studies focusing on other aspects of linguistic analysis and la
 nguage technology development.\n\nThe conference is hosted by Buryat State
  University\, Ulan-Ude\, Russian Federation. The venue of the conference i
 s located on the shore of the Lake Baikal (Baigal)\, The water temperature
  during the conference is usually the highest in the year.\n\nThe followin

DESCRIPTION:The languages of the world offer their speakers different mean
 s of encoding location information and of grounding utterances spatially b
 y pointing to the surrounding landscape. Languages vary both in the spatia
 l concepts they require speakers to hold and in the degree of routine atte
 ntion to landscape they demand. There is a now a wealth of findings from d
 ifferent spatial linguistic subsystems in many languages (Frames of Refere
 nce\, topological relation markers\, locative predicates\, landscape terms
 \, toponyms)\, and one aim of this seminar is to investigate cross-linguis
 tic tendencies in the ways such spatial subsystems play together within si
 ngle languages. Another aim is to examine the usefulness of the ethnophysi
 ographic model suggested for landscape terminology when applied to other a
 spects of spatial language\, such as spatial conjugations.\n\nWe invite co
 ntributions addressing the following three themes: The theme Coding strate
 gies covers cross-linguistic variation and preferences in presenting place
  and direction information as either foreground or background information 
 (lexical vs. grammatical)\, as core or periphery (argument vs. adjunct) an
 d as independent or fused with other types of meanings (dedicated morpheme
 s vs. portmanteaus). The theme Dependencies across subsystems explores the
  ways different parts of grammar and lexicon expressing location and direc
 tion either reinforce each other (supporting similar concepts and distinct
 ions across scales and domains) or supplement each other (division of labo
 ur). The theme Place-marking systems as parts of ecological and cultural n
 iches zooms out to the relationships between linguistic strategies for spa
 tial reference and grounding\, the landscapes these strategies are used in
  and the speech communities they serve\, asking also whether their underpi
 nning by traditional landbased practices makes them especially vulnerable 
 in language endangerment contexts.\n\nInvited Speakers:\n\nNiclas Burenhul

SUMMARY:GLOW39 - Workshop on Perspectivization
DTSTART;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20160408T000000
DTEND;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20160408T000000
UID:http://linguistlist.org/issues/26/26-3189.html
DESCRIPTION:Perspectivization is an inextricable property of linguistic ex
 pressions: examples vary from rather obvious lexical instances like deicti
 c vs. intrinsic readings of spatial expressions to more elusive discourse-
 level cases of perspective-dependence like point-of-view narration (s. Can
 trall\, 1974)\, or free indirect discourse (Banfield\, 1982). On a more ge
 neral and somewhat philosophical level\, one might say that epistemic pers
 pectivization is the hallmark of the subjectivity of human experience\, an
 d that linguistic reflexes of perspectivization are the means by which pri
 viledged first-person experiences of speakers and hearers may become part 
 of the common ground. While its generality\, and the wide range of issues 
 it covers may be part of the fascination the notion of perspectivization i
 nstills\, it is probably also the reason why this notion\, thus broadly co
 nstrued\, has so far evaded the grasp of formal semantics and pragmatics. 
 By way of example\, while phenomena related to spatial perspectivization m
 ight reasonably be formalized with recourse to some formal rendering of Bu
 ehler's notion of origo (s. Wunderlich\, 1991\; Bierwisch\, 1996)\, it is 
 far from clear whether this notion should play a role in a formal treatmen
 t of more specific phenomena like (anti-) logophoricity (s. Sells\, 1987)\
 , or the availability of de re vs. de se readings in control constructions
  (s. Landau\, 2014).\n\nThe aim of this workshop is twofold: on the theore
 tical side\, we want to address the question of what the basic building bl
 ocks of perspectivized content are\, and how the interpretation of perspec
 tivized lingiustics expressions is to be conceived of at the syntax-semant
 ics interface. For example\, is some notion of origo lying at the heart of
  perspectivization? Can this notion be reconciled with more technical noti
 ons like centered worlds? Do we need concept generators (Percus & Sauerlan
 d\, 2003) to account not only for de se readings\, but for perspectivized 
 content in general? \n\nOn the empirical side\, we think that psycholingui
 stics has made some progress in providing evidence for some of the theoret
 ical terms mentioned above\, and how the processing of perspectivized expr
 essions might be understood. However\, we think there is still a lot of gr
 ound to be covered. By way of analogy to the theoretical questions above\,
  we might ask whether some kind of an (analogous) spatial representation o
 f an origo is the basis of perspectivized mental representation? Or do we 
 have to assume more complex\, specialized representations and mechanisms t
 hat enter into the online construction of perspectivized content? Are thes
 e processes specific to language\, or do they borrow from more general cog
 nitive mechanisms (e.g. from social cognition)? We are confident that psyc
 holinguistic evidence from language processing\, as well as language acqui
 sition\, can help to refine our understanding of what perspectivization re
 ally is.\n\nInvited Speakers:\n\nJesse Harris (UCLA)\nStephen Wechsler (UT

 form\, metalinguistic activity and writing\, linguistic theories and gramm
 ar teaching\, teachers and students’ beliefs\, diachronic perspective on
  the role of grammar in language teaching\, pedagogical grammar and school
  curriculum ...). It is anticipated that papers will consider both epistem
 ological and methodological issues alongside practical considerations.\n\n
 Following the positive results of the First Conference\, we have decided t
 o maintain the overall theme and the free communications section\; however
 \, in this edition\, symposia organized by research groups that revolve ar

 scription and Sciences WORLDS is an annual workshop series conducted by th
 e Department of Linguistics\, K.M. Institute of Hindi and Linguistics\, Dr
 . B.R. Ambedkar University\, Agra. The major aim of the workshop series is
  to popularise and spread awareness about Linguistics among the undergradu
 ate students of the country so as to encourage them to take up higher educ
 ation and research in Linguistics. It is part of this effort that we have 
 also instituted the  WORLDS Fellowship which would be available for the o
 utstanding undergraduate participants of the workshop for pursuing M.A. in
  Linguistics at the department and attending the workshop. The fellowship 
 includes free accommodation and travel and maintenance grant for attending
  the workshop\, full refund of admission and tuition fee for pursuing M.A.
  in Linguistics at the Dept. of Linguistics\, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar University
 \, Agra (if the awardee decides to take admission at the dept.) and a cert
 ificate of excellence. The maximum number of fellowships to be awarded thi
 s year is 5.\n\nThis workshop is conceived as a mini fieldwork where the p
 articipants will be exposed to the basics of data collection\, analysis an
 d description\, which will be conducted by some of the leading field lingu
 ists and experts of language description in India\, followed by practical 
 sessions on conducting fieldwork on the participants' own language. It is 
 expected to expose the participants to the methods and ways of a linguist 
 and would serve well to combine the theoretical promise with the real\, pr
 actical problems and joys of the field!\n\nApplication for WORLDS – 2 an

  to discuss recent trends in language development\, language policies and 
 linguistic research on metalinguistic debates. Papers should be on the fol
 lowing topics:\n\n1. Language ideologies (especially in public discourse)\
 n2. Ideologies of mobility and sedentarism\n3. Meta-linguistic discourse o
 n new dialects\, pidgins and creoles\n4. The evolution of new national lan
 guages\n5. Standardisation of new varieties – from exonormative to endon

  conference concern raising awareness of learning problems\, as well as pr
 oposing effective ways and methods of dealing with language learning diffi
 culties to further the foreign language study. Therefore\, we invite speci
 alists from the fields of second language acquisition and foreign language
  learning and teaching\, bilingualism and multilingualism\, contrastive li
 nguistics\, language assessment\, literacies\, discourse analysis\, langua
 ge pedagogy\, lexicography\, language planning and policies\, pragmatics\,

 \nCall for Papers Submission Deadline: May 8\, 2015\n\nCharles Sanders Pei
 rce’s concept of evolutionary love is behind the theme of this year’s 
 conference\, which prompts an exploration into the digital age of virtual 
 relationships and identities. How have these relationships grown\, or chan
 ged\, in our new worlds of digital communication\, multimedial art\, and v
 irtual realities? Who are we now\, in this new environment\, and how are w
 e to know ourselves? How have we changed in our new modes of connectedness
 \, of friendship\, of love? Where is our center\, and where is that Other 
 with whom we have dialogue? Have we discovered\, or slipped into\, a newly
  digitalized\, more extensively virtual\, postmodern\, and intertextual we
 b of subjectivity? What are the consequences for authentic encounter in th
 is world? What is preserved\, what is lost\, what is transformed into some
 thing radically new? And where are we heading\, as individuals\, families\
 , societies\, communities?\n\nAs always\, we welcome abstracts on any subj
 ect with a connection to semiotics (both theoretical and applied)\, not so
 lely those inspired by this year’s theme. We encourage you to reach out 
 to your semiotically-inclined colleagues by organizing thematic sessions o
 r panels\, as well as submitting individual papers and posters. Our Societ
 y is interdisciplinary and international\, and we welcome voices from all 
 communities.\n\nFor more information\, visit http://semioticsocietyofameri

DESCRIPTION:The Workshop on the Languages of Melanesia is hosted by the AN
 U and will be held at the coastal campus at Kioloa (NSW coast) on 21-23 Ju
 ne.\n\nThe WLM is an informal workshop with a focus on Papuan languages\, 
 although submissions on all languages from Melanesia are happily welcomed.
  The workshop provides an opportunity to present on exciting and explorato
 ry work rather than published outcomes all within an environment of lively
  discussion and a stunning natural setting.\n\nThe workshop also involves 
 many opportunities for social interaction with fellow scholars of all leve
 ls\, including a group bushwalk at some point during the workshop.\n\nInvi
 ted speaker will be announced shortly.

DESCRIPTION:The Workshop on Infant Speech Perception (WISP) will highlight
  recent research on infants’ developing abilities to perceive and learn 
 the phonological\, morphological and prosodic systems of language.  Resear
 ch has shown that children make use of perceptual cues very early in life 
 to bootstrap the learning of phonemes\, carry out processes of word segmen
 tation\, and identify morphological boundaries. However\, the mechanisms u
 nderlying how these levels of language learning are integrated and represe
 nted in early language development is still unclear. Even less is known ab
 out how these aspects of language learning proceed in early bilinguals or 
 children with hearing loss.  \n\nThe goal of this workshop is to bring tog
 ether researchers working on various aspects of phonology\, morphology and
  prosody to discuss novel techniques and paradigms that will shed light on
  the diverse roles of speech perception abilities at various stages of inf
 ant development\, across languages and populations. The workshop will incl
 ude keynote addresses and invited talks by experts in the fields of lingui
 stics\, cognitive science\, and developmental psychology.

DESCRIPTION:The bi-annual meeting of the German Society for Computational 
 Linguistics and Language Technology (GSCL) in 2015 will take place from Se
 ptember 30 to October 2 at the University of Duisburg-Essen.\n\nThe main c
 onference theme is ''Deep vs. shallow?''.\n\nCurrently\, computational lin
 guistics as a field seems to split in two camps: Those interested in 'deep
 '\, explanatory\, potentially even cognitively motivated models and those 
 interested in harnessing the power of emerging big data collections to sol
 ve practical problems efficiently. While the first camp often fights with 
 a lack of coverage of the intended phenomena\, the second camp is occasion
 ally criticized as naively counting the contents of bags of words.\n\nOf c
 ourse\, the conference theme is designed to provoke contradiction: Isn't t
 he goal ultimately a synthesis of both approaches that allows linguistic t
 heory to use 'big data' efficiently and allows broad coverage technologies
  to be theoretically well-founded? The conference aims to discuss the dive
 rgence of 'deep' and 'shallow' analysis\, but especially also how to achie
 ve to a synthesis constructively.\n\nKeynote Speakers:\n\nChris Biemann (T

 annual conference that brings together researchers\, educators\, and stude
 nts in the fields of foreign language education\, TEFL/TESL (Teaching Engl
 ish as a Foreign or Second Language)\, linguistics\, and applied linguisti
 cs. We have changed the name this year to reflect our evolving emphasis on
  supporting research in language education more broadly amongst graduate s
 tudents\, faculty\, and educators.\n\nBridging the gap between research an
 d practice is an inevitable challenge in the field of foreign/second langu
 age pedagogy. TexLER unites scholars and educators from diverse contexts w
 ho strive to connect research findings to classroom practices\, thus shapi
 ng the future direction of language education. TexLER welcomes research st
 udies and practice-oriented presentations that clearly establish strong co
 nnections between theory and practice in diverse contexts. Our goal is to 
 offer an interdisciplinary forum for all those interested in research find
 ings with implications for the classroom as well as those interested in pe
 dagogical approaches to language learning grounded on empirical findings.\
 n\nWe’re also happy to announce that this year TexLER will host the “3
 rd International Research Colloquium: Educational Linguistics and Language
  Education”\, which seeks to connect language education researchers in t
 he U.S. and Mexico and beyond.

DESCRIPTION:L’activité métalinguistique est source d’hétérogénéi
 té dans les langues et les discours puisqu’elle induit des strates de m
 étalangage venant se superposer ou se mêler\, de manière plus ou moins 
 indistincte\, à ces mêmes langues et discours. Par ailleurs\, le champ m
 ême du métalinguistique est lieu d’hétérogénéité dans la mesure o
 ù il recouvre des modalités et des formes indéfiniment variées\, selon
  les objets langagiers sur lesquels il porte mais aussi selon qu’il est 
 commentaire et modalisation du dire\, ou qu’il est simplement reformulat
 ion venant expliciter ou redire le dire. On renvoie ici d’une part aux d
 istinctions introduites par J. Authier-Revuz (2004) entre du métalangage 
 portant sur la langue\, sur le discours « en train de se faire »\, sur l
 e discours d’un autre\, avec toutes les variantes possibles plus ou moin
 s distinguables\, d’autre part à l’activité épilinguistique dont pa
 rle A. Culioli(Culioli&Normand\, 2005)comparée au métalangage didactique
 -scientifique sous ses différentes formes\, qu’évoque J. Rey-Debove (1
 997 : 22-23). \n\nPeuvent relever en droit de l’activité métalinguisti
 que tout commentaire sur le dire\, mais aussi toute modalisation\, et enco
 re toute explicitation\, et aussi toute répétition\, et peut-être aussi
  tout dire\, s’il est vrai que tout dire emporte avec lui sa modalisatio
 n.\n\nIl sera attendu que les propositions s’interrogent sur la façon d
 ont le champ métalinguistique étudié  mobilise l’hétérogénéité.L
 es thématiques suivantes pourront en particulier être abordées :\n\nFor
 mes du Métalinguistique :\n\n- Les différentes formes prises par l’act
 ivité métalinguistique : les formes pour parler du dire et les formes po
 ur redire\n- Les frontières et les limites du champ métalinguistique : m
 étalangage et prédication\, métalangage et discours rapporté\, métala

 ’anaphore)\n- Délimitation des segments métalinguistiques \;marquage o
 u non marquage\n- Métalangages didactiques\, métalangages scientifiques\
 , métalangages ordinaires\, gloses et commentaires épilinguistiques\n- L
 e champ des unités métalinguistiques : mots de la métalangue\, mots du 
 discours\, modalisations \; problème du fonctionnement métalinguistique 
 de certaines unités de langue\n\nFonctions du Métalinguistique  :\n\n- M
 étalinguistique etsavoir sur la langue\, le langage\, le sens\, l’inter
 action\n- Le métalinguistique comme ressort de littérarité : relations 
 entre activité métalinguistique et force poétique des signifiants\n- M
 étalangage\, langage\, et langage intérieur\n- Métalinguistique et sém
 iotique\nLe métalinguistique comme activité \n- L’écriture comme acti
 vité métalinguistique : l’écriture comme représentation du discours 
 voire comme conscience réflexive sur son propre discours\, l’écriture 
 comme représentation de la langue\n- L’activité métalinguistique tell
 e qu’elle se manifeste dans la dénomination et la catégorisation dans 
 le discours des activités langagières (dénomination des genres de disco
 urs des actes de langage\, etc.)\n- Les genres métalinguistiques : dictio
 nnaires\, gloses\, glossaires\, grammaires\, modèles linguistiques\, leç
 ons de langue\, méthodes de langue\, jeux de mots etc.\n- Déclencheurs d
 e l’activité métalinguistique : apprentissage de langues secondes \;  
 apprentissage scolaire de la langue en général \; lapsus\, jeux de mots\
 , malentendus\, équivoques etc. \; questions de société (féminisation 
 des noms de métier \; réformes orthographiques \; purismes \; langue et

DESCRIPTION:In the 21st century\, studies in the field of linguistics\, li
 terature and culture are not always carried out in isolation from other do
 mains\; they often cross traditional boundaries and interrelate with other
  disciplines due to the emergence of new needs. Indeed\, interdisciplinari
 ty and hybridity is fast becoming the rule rather than the exception and i
 t is not surprising to find research involving several disciplines with mu
 tually beneficial results and practical implications for various professio
 nal fields. Furthermore\, the third edition of CILLEC aims to cover issues
  related to the role of language\, literature and culture in several insti
 tutional\, social and intercultural contexts. In the light of this scenari
 o and following the success of the conferences held in 2012/2013 and 2013/
 2014\, we are pleased to announce the third edition of the International C
 onference of Linguistics\, Literature and Cultural Studies (CILLEC) entitl
 ed “Challenges and Possibilities for Language\, Literature\, and Culture
  in a Globalised World” to be held at the Catholic University of Murcia 
 (UCAM) on 10th and 11 September 2015. \n\nContributions are welcome from a

  the topic of the conference. \n\nPlenary Speakers: \n\nProf. Maria Vittor
 ia Calvi: Professor of 'Dipartimento di Scienze della Mediazione linguisti
 ca e di Studi interculturali'\, University of Milan. She is the President 
 of the Italian Hispanists Association and member of the CERLIS (Centro di 
 Ricerca sui Linguaggi Specialistici) at the University of Bergamo. Profess

 e empirical support for\, or raise problems for\, extant theories of conte
 xt-sensitivity?\n\nShould an account of pervasive context-sensitivity also
  provide an account of metaphor and other non-literal uses of language?\n\
 nHow should we take debates about pervasive context-sensitivity forward? W
 hat aspects of debate are open to empirical investigation and in what way?
  How does the debate about pervasive context impact on cognate areas\, suc
 h as computational modelling of language understanding?\n\nIs the debate d
 eepened by bringing to bear research and intuitions from those working wit
 h different linguistic and cultural backgrounds?

DESCRIPTION:Human social interaction is enabled by mutual understanding\, 
 the development of which is crucial for children’s participation in the 
 social world. The capacity for mutual understanding is increasingly a core
  issue for researchers in linguistics\, cognitive science\, neuroscience\,
  and psychology\, though each has traditionally approached the matter with
  different emphases and conceptualizations (theory of mind\, common ground
 \, intersubjectivity\, perspective-taking\, etc.). This diversity of termi
 nology may obscure the real connections between these adjacent fields and 
 the substantive overlap in their subject matter. As a step toward fosterin
 g cross-disciplinary exchange\, this workshop provides a forum to share re
 cent findings\, and assembles complementary lines of research to promote p
 roductive collaboration across methods and perspectives.\n\nWe seek to add
 ress the following broad questions:\n\n- What is the nature of the link be
 tween interaction and mutual understanding in children's development? \n- 
 What are the relative contributions of different types of participation (e
 .g.\, active engagement versus observation) in shaping these sociocognitiv
 e abilities?\n- What environmental or contextual features potentiate or co
 nstrain the development of intersubjective understanding?\n- How might dif
 ferent approaches enrich\, complement and contextualize our understanding 
 of social cognition\, language\, and interaction in human ontogeny?\n\nSpe

 ctions between questions and disjunctions (see the Workshop description). 
 On the second day\, the Workshop will feature a poster session. \n\nThe in
 vited speakers for this Workshop are:\n\nValentina Bianchi (University of 
 Siena)\nDewei Che (Chongqing University\, China)\nJacopo Garzonio (Univers
 ity of Venice)\nIon Giurgea (The Institute of Linguistics of the Romanian 
 Academy)\nKen Hiraiwa (Meiji Gakuin University\, Tokyo)\nClemens Mayr (ZAS
 )\nCécile Meier (University of Frankfurt)\nCecilia Poletto (University of
  Frankfurt)\nUli Sauerland (ZAS)\nThomas Ede Zimmermann (University of Fra
 nkfurt)\n\nWorkshop Description:\n\nThe relationship between questions and
  disjunctions has already been the subject of semantic investigation for m
 any years\, in response to the evident parallelisms that interrogatives an
 d sentences coordinated by disjunction display on an interpretive level. S
 till unclear\, however\, is the extent to which these common interpretativ
 e properties overlap. Even more significant in this respect are the cross-
 linguistic syntactic and morphological correspondences between questions a
 nd disjunctions: many languages resort to the same morpheme both as a disj
 unction and as a question particle\; in other languages\, questions can be
  formed by means of a disjunctive structure. In order to capture the inter
 pretive components that are in fact characteristics of both constructions\
 , it is essential to explore the formal variation not only within a langua
 ge\, but also cross-linguistically. At the same time\, the semantic analys
 is can help us understand the different typological patterns and syntactic
  constructions: for example\, with respect to the question of why many lan
 guages exhibit distributional parallelisms between disjunction\, question 
 particles and focus particles\, or\, likewise\, in regard to the phenomeno
 n whereby\, cross-linguistically\, only certain types of question feature 
 a disjunctive particle or morphology.\n\nThe aim of this International Wor
 kshop\, jointly organized by four linguistic departments within the Facult
 y of Philological and Cultural Studies of the University of Vienna\, is to
  bring together different views on the connections between questions and d
 isjunctions\, and\, therefore\, to yield a novel perspective on the variou
 s problems within the single discipline. Central is the question of which 
 (morpho-)syntactic and semantic connections exist between these two univer
 sally available linguistic constructions – questions and disjunctive coo
 rdinations. It will also be discussed how these constructions are realized
  typologically\, hence cross-linguistically\, and which correlations betwe
 en the single components of both constructions can be found within a singl
 e language and in typological distribution. Issues and hypotheses from all
  three linguistic areas – syntax\, semantics and typology – will there
 fore be covered in this workshop.

DESCRIPTION:The Institute of Applied Linguistics of the Faculty of E-Learn
 ing Technologies and Humanities\, Riga Technical University invites you to
  participate in a conference “Meaning in Translation: Illusion of Precis
 ion” on 11-13 May\, 2016.\n\nComplicated issue of representation of mean
 ing in translation has always been a focus of research in Translation Stud
 ies. Can meaning be transferred across languages or is it simply an illusi
 on that what has been said in one language can be accurately represented i
 n another? Different scholars have taken different stances on this issue. 
 Opinions vary\, absolute denial of the existence of interlingual equivalen
 ce as such and beliefs that someday computers will be able to translate be
 tter than human translators can be mentioned among extreme points of view.
 \n\nThe conference will bring researchers\, translators\, students and lan
 guage policy makers together to create a platform for dynamic and construc
 tive debate\, networking and research initiation.\n\nWe hope that the conf
 erence will become a forum where scholars of various linguistic and cultur
 al backgrounds\, studying a variety of subjects\, can share their opinion 
 on the matters of utmost importance in the field of translation theory and
  practice: can meaning be accurately represented in translation? Is loss o
 f certain components of meaning inevitable? What compensation mechanisms c
 an be used to ensure that the target text is not inferior in comparison wi
 th the source text? What are the implications of the failure to transfer b
 oth semantic and pragmatic aspects of meaning in the process of translatio
 n and cross-cultural communication? How can the developments in the field 
 of corpus linguistics and new methods of discourse analysis contribute to 
 contrastive analysis and translation of texts?\n\nWe would like to express
  our sincere gratitude to our keynote speakers:\n\nBasil Hatim - Professor

 reover\, even incessant crawling of the web has failed to yield anything o
 ther than at best mediocre results in machine translation.\n\nFinally\, th
 is tendency manifests itself in the social sciences with psychologism\, th
 e reduction of exigent social dynamics to cognitive and other psychologica

  to the non-engaged intellectual\; on the other\, to bewildering interpret
 ations of postmodern thinkers geared mainly to giving instructors a free p

DESCRIPTION:The Old World Conference on Phonology announces its workshop o
 n variation in phonology\, to be held January 13\, 2016.\n\nPhonological v
 ariation is non-identical phonological behaviour under identical condition
 s. It occurs when one and the same grammatical/semantic function has more 
 than one exponent\, and the choice between them is conditioned by dialecta
 l/idiolectal factors (such as region\, style\, social status\, etc.) and n
 ot by the morpho-phonological or syntactic environment. This type of varia
 tion manifests itself in the ''vacillation'' of forms in one and the same 
 cell of the same paradigm (e.g. English learn+PAST: learned/learnt\; Hunga
 rian fürd- 'bathe'+INF: fyrød-ni/fyrd-ɛni). Phonological variation of t
 he ''lexical''type occurs when the comparable phonological properties of f
 orms in same (functionally/grammatically/morphosyntactically identified) c
 ell of the paradigms of different lexical items are different although the
  relevant phonological/syntactic conditioning factors are the same (e.g. E
 nglish keep+PAST / seep+PAST: kept/seeped\; Hungarian víz 'water' +INE / 
 sír 'grave' +INE: viːz-bɛn/ʃiːr-bɑn). The two types of variation oft
 en occur together\, e.g. Hungarian verb stems derived from the nouns matek
  'maths'\, koncert 'concert\, roller 'scooter': mɑtɛk-oz-(ik) / *mɑtɛk
 -ɛz-(ik)\, *konʦɛrt-oz-(ik) / konʦɛrt-ɛz-(ik)\, rolːɛr-oz-(ik) / r
 olːɛr-ɛz-(ik).

DESCRIPTION:The Doctoral Consortium at EUROLAN-2015 will provide a good op
 portunity for graduate students (PhD and MSc heading towards PhD studies) 
 investigating topics in Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Pro
 cessing towards Linguistic Open Data and\, more generally\, the Semantic W
 eb to present their current work and receive constructive feedback and gui
 dance on future research\, both from the general audience and the invited 
 lecturers at the Summer School. The opinions expressed freely and in a fri
 endly atmosphere will help presenters to correct modeling errors or miscon
 ceptions in early phases of their PhD research\, to exercise their final d
 efending in the front of an international panel of experts\, to enhance th
 e evaluation and comparison of their results with the state ­of­ the­ a
 rt\, to find new ideas for continuing their investigations\, to enhance pr
 esentation skills\, and\, not the least\, as often has been the case in fo
 rmer meetings of this kind\, to establish future collaboration coalitions.
 \n\nThe main outcomes for a participant at the Doctoral Consortium are:\n\
 n- Bright & new research ideas and guidance from top researchers\n- Partic
 ipation in a supportive community\, networking with other scholars from th
 e same and/or different research areas\, at various stages of their resear
 ch and activity\n- During the EUROLAN week/s: enjoy a camaraderie atmosphe
 re through common activities and social events\, as well as an excursion o
 n July 18\n\nThe Doctoral Consortium will be held as a workshop during 3 o
 r 4 consecutive evenings (1.5 hour slots) in the first week of the EUROLAN
  2015 Summer School\, between July 14 and July 17.

DESCRIPTION:''Ruído branco'' ou ''efeitos borboleta''? -- Micro-variaçã
 o linguística e suas repercussões no(s) sistema(s) linguístico(s) do Po
 rtuguês\n\nApesar dos inúmeros estudos dedicados à variação linguíst
 ica nos últimos anos\, estes tipicamente têm procurado estabelecer gener
 alizações o mais amplo possíveis\, isto é\, os investigadores interess
 aram-se sobretudo sobre fenómenos de representatividade (ou variáveis es
 tatisticamente altamente relevantes)\, em detrimento dos fenómenos de mic
 ro-variação\, apesar de terem documentado um número bastante significat
 ivo destes. Este procedimento entende-se se tivermos em conta as modelaç
 ões clássicas da linguística. Porém\, nos últimos anos o interesse do
 s estudos da linguagem tem vindo a focalizar cada vez mais o falante\, enq
 uanto potencial agente modificador da linguagem\, e a comunidade linguíst
 ica envolvente (Beckner et al. 2009). Esta mudança ficou a dever-se sobre
 tudo ao reconhecimento da relevância do contexto comunicativo e da inten
 ção do falante na seleção das suas estratégias comunicativas\, podend
 o estas estar num processo complexo de mudança linguística. Além disso\
 , este tipo de variação está também a ser tomado em consideração cad
 a vez mais em teorias gramaticais universalistas\, como demonstra o concei
 to de “nano-parâmetro” (Roberts 2014).\n\nAo mesmo tempo\, linguistas
  começaram a estudar o português sob a ótica da teoria de sistemas din
 âmicos complexos (Castilho 2009\, Paiva & Nascimento 2011). Uma das obser
 vações básicas em que esta se baseia é que\, em tais sistemas\, condi
 ções iniciais minimamente distintas podem resultar em grandes transforma
 ções e verdadeiras revoluções. A valorização de ‘micro-situações
 ’ comunicativas obriga-nos a reanalisar a importância de fenómenos de 
 mudança e variação linguística aparentemente marginais e o potencial d
 iâmico das suas interdependências num sistema complexo. \n\nDeste modo\,
  a nossa secção visa a discussão dos muitos casos (que qualquer estudo 
 empírico revela) de fenómenos que parecem fugir às tendências principa
 is de uma determinada variavel linguística\, e refletir a sua importânci
 a para questões centrais da linguística portuguesa. Queremos discutir se
  se trata de meros artefatos da metodologia empregue\, e que\, portanto\, 
 podem ser negligenciados ou se formam parte integrante de um sistema\, que
  por sua vez é parte constituinte de sistemas em movimento? O caráter in
 erentemente interdisciplinar dos estudos de sistemas dinâmicos complexos 
 (Castilho 2009) poderia servir como fonte de inspiração\, pois muitas ve
 zes a aproximação a fenómenos marginais desde perspectivas mais limitad
 as dificulta a percepção do seu status na língua.\n\nAssim\, esperamos 
 entender melhor\, por exemplo\, as evoluções mais recentes no âmbito da
  fonética e fonologia na área da Grande Lisboa e a projeção destas ass
 ociada ao prestígio económico e político da cidade em Portugal\, ou as 
 repercussões ao nível da linguagem dos jovens e as mudanças nos hábito
 s e estratégias comunicativas destes e a sua influência no sistema da l
 íngua portuguesa\, originando do contato linguístico em bairros com uma 
 elevada taxa de imigrantes cabo-verdianos como\, por exemplo\, a Cova da M
 oura em Lisboa [...]\n\n[for a complete description and references\, pleas

 onological framework. In an informal atmosphere\, we discuss a broad range
  of topics\, including the phonological description of languages\, issues 
 in phonological theory\, aspects of phonological acquisition and implicati

DESCRIPTION:Instances of civil disorder in the form of riots\, strikes and
  protests have become increasingly frequent in response to economic declin
 e and other structural conditions\, in the UK\, Europe and globally. Far f
 rom political apathy\, these activities suggest increased levels of public
  concern and civic engagement. We see such forms of engagement\, as well a
 s media coverage and government responses\, as part of a political process
  which contains a significant discursive dimension. Discourse plays a fund
 amental part in defining agendas\, voicing objections\, framing debates\, 
 legitimating or delegitimating actions\, and in formulating policies. We t
 herefore understand the discursive practices of social movements\, the med
 ia and policy-makers\, as political practices. Understanding the complexit
 ies of this political process and the discursive dimensions involved requi
 res a multidisciplinary approach addressing issues of language\, image\, j
 ournalism\, media\, power and political economy. In so far as media and di
 scourse research each provide insights into our understanding of social\, 
 historical\, political and economic contexts and conflicts\, the symposium
  will be of interest for scholars concerned more broadly with semiotics an
 d social practice and the symposium will address representations of riots\
 , strike and protests.

DESCRIPTION:Despite the initiatives from the European institutions calling
  on states to recognize and institutionalize the linguistic diversity of t
 heir territories\, as well as to consider language teaching with an aim to
 ward sensitizing and training people in general language education that is
  more open to the plurality one finds today in the non-English speaking co
 untries—a situation in which there is constant reinforcement of the cons
 olidated hegemonic position of English (Calvet\, 2014\, Truchot\, 2010a) n
 ot only as a foreign language but also as a teaching language. In his rece
 nt work\, Tullio De Mauro (De Mauro\, 2014) wonders if\, faced with an exc
 essive multiplicity of languages as a result of its expansion and defense 
 of regional languages\, a democratic Europe should not rather follow the I
 ndian bi-lingual model of incorporating English as the lingua franca of in
 stitutions and education.\n\nThe current state of globalization requires i
 ndividuals\, who are today mostly multilingual\, to demonstrate adaptive c
 apacities to meet the increasing diffusion of knowledge (education\, resea
 rch and publication). Within this abundance\, and for the sake of internat
 ional recognition\, one notices that training schemes taught in English ar
 e increasing exponentially in many higher institutions in Europe (Derivry-
 Plard et al\, 2013). This strong trend is most often justified in terms of
  its attractiveness to students and international researchers\, and in ter
 ms of neo-liberally-inspired policies of excellence  (Gaspard\, 2013) and 
 these criteria are\, in the vast majority of cases\, evaluated positively 
 in quality evaluation mechanisms (Charlier\, Croché\, Leclercq\, 2012). H
 owever\, to this day\, no scientific monitoring has been able to measure t
 he effects of these practices which contrast with the mobility schemes\, s
 uch as Erasmus\, conceived of at the very beginning as devices based on le
 arning the language of the host country. In this context\, various questio
 ns arise:\n\n- Does Internationalization lead to mono-\, bi- or multilingu
 al education?\n- How to rethink the teaching of English in this context?\n
 - How to rethink the disciplines of foreign languages and cultures (Warner
 \, 2014) in face of anglicisation?\n- What about disciplinary content tran
 smission (Causa et al\, 2012)?\n- What overall economic impact these chang
 es have regarding language policies (Gazzola and Grin\, 2013)?\n- What eco
 nomic and scientific « profitability » would mono-bilingualism (English 
 + « local » language) have or not have compared to a diversification of 
 multilingualism?\n- To what extent do choices made in language policy and 
 language teaching favor or not favor the democratization of a « knowledge
  society »?

SUMMARY:Under One Roof: Sharing a Form with Focus

DESCRIPTION:Meeting Description:\n\nA great number of formal linguistic me
 ans can be used to express the information structural partition between th
 e focus and the background of a sentence. Under closer scrutiny\, many of 
 the formal means that are usually interpreted as encoding focus turn out t
 o have other functions as well.\n\nThe aim of this workshop is to investig
 ate the polyfunctionality of linguistic means associated with focus. We ar
 e especially interested in cases of polyfunctionality that go beyond the w
 ell-known cases where the same linguistic form is associated with focus an
 d contrast or exhaustivity. For example\, French clefts can serve to narro
 wly focus the clefted constituent\, but also to create cohesion with the p
 receding context. Another example is particles which encode TAM functions\
 , but also trigger a focus interpretation. \n\nTopics to be addressed incl
 ude (but are not limited to) the following issues:\n\n- Patterns of Polyfu
 nctionality\nWhich are the additional functions expressed by linguistic me
 ans associated with focus? Are these functions part of the semantics of th
 e respective linguistic means or the result of pragmatic inference? Are th
 ere recurring patterns of polyfunctionality?\n\n- Polyfunctionality and Ty
 pes of Linguistic Means\nIs there a relationship between different pattern
 s of polyfunctionality and the formal types of linguistic means associated
  with focus? Are there patterns typically associated with a certain lingui
 stic level to the exclusion of the others (e.g. with prosodic\, but not wi
 th morphological or syntactic means)?\n\n- Polyfunctionality and the Categ
 orial Status of Focus\nIn the literature on information structure there is
  an ongoing debate whether focus is an integral part of grammar or rather 
 belongs to pragmatics. In this regard\, the claim that focus is a universa
 l linguistic category has recently been called into question.\n-- To what 
 extent can the analysis of polyfunctional patterns contribute to this ongo
 ing debate?\n-- Can polyfunctionality be considered as a counter-argument 
 against focus as a (universal) linguistic category?\n-- Can\, on the other
  hand\, the one-to-one mapping between a linguistic form and a focus inter
 pretation be considered as evidence for focus as a linguistic category in 
 this specific language?\n\nOrganizers: Dina El Zarka\, Anna Gazdik\, Steff

 ate: 11 June 2015\nTime: 9 to 12 o’clock\nSpeakers: Fanny Forsberg Lunde
 ll\, Jan Hulstijn\, Nivja de Jong\, Folkert Kuiken\, Cornelia Lahmann\n\nW
 hat makes a second language (L2) user a proficient language user? This is 
 a highly controversial question given the different views on the construct
  of language proficiency. In the SLA literature it is however more or less
  agreed upon that the construct of L2 proficiency is multi-componential it
  may be captured by assessing the complexity\, accuracy\, and fluency (CAF
 ) of L2 productions (Housen\, Kuiken\, & Vedder\, 2012).\n\nThe complexity
  of an object has been defined in terms of the number of constituents and 
 their relationship (Bulté & Housen\, 2012). The first two presentations w
 ill focus on the construct of complexity as a dimension of L2 proficiency.
  Whereas the first talk will focus on complexity in the speech of adult na
 tive speakers (Hulstijn)\, the second talk will focus primarily on L2 writ
 ten production (Kuiken).\n\nRegarding fluency one may distinguish between 
 cognitive fluency\, utterance fluency and perceived fluency (Segalowitz\, 
 2010)\, and for utterance fluency the distinction has been made between re
 pair\, breakdown\, and speed fluency (Skehan\, 2003). Fluency is thus a mu
 ltifaceted construct. The third presentation will shed light on this const
 ruct as an indicator of L2 proficiency (de Jong).\n\nWhile the majority of
  studies assessing complexity\, accuracy\, and fluency of L2 productions h
 ave focussed on the L2 classroom context and beginning to advanced levels 
 of L2 proficiency\, less research has been carried out applying the CAF ap
 proach for learners beyond the advanced stage and in a naturalistic L2 lea
 rning environment. The fourth presentation will focus on high-level spoken
  L2 French (Forsberg Lundell)\, whereas the fifth presentation will addres
 s high-level spoken L2 English (Lahmann). Both presentations will also lin
 k their results to the debate on the possibility of nativelike attainment.
 \n\nAttendance is free of charge.\nThe event is kindly funded by the Cente
 r for Language and Cognition Groningen (CLCG) and by NWO (project number:

DESCRIPTION:Title of the Colloquium:  “Metadiscourse in spoken language
 ” \n\nOrganisers: Hermine Penz (University of Graz\, Austria)\, Eva-Mari
 a Graf (University of Klagenfurt\, Austria)\n\nDescription: 	\n\nThe fact 
 that human beings can talk about language as they can do about other thing
 s is one of the distinguishing features between human and animal language 
 and has been termed ‘reflexivity’ by Hockett (1960).  This phenomenon 
 has been discussed by the majority of linguists by using various construct
 ions with the prefix ‘meta’\, such as ‘metalanguage’\, ‘metadisc
 ourse’\, ‘meta-talk’\, ‘metacommunication’. According to Mey (20
 01:173) “a ‘metalanguage’ indicates a language that is about languag
 e\, one level ‘up’ from the language itself\, the ‘object language
 ’ […]. A metalanguage indicates\, comments on\, examines\, criticizes 
 etc. what happens on the level of the object language”.\n\nThe aim of th
 is colloquium is to explore the function and usage of this type of languag
 e in spoken discourse. We thereby understand metadiscourse as “discourse
  about the ongoing discourse”\, which is the narrow view of metadiscours
 e (see also Mauranen 1993 and 2010). It is an essential feature of spoken 
 interactions and is not restricted to any particular type of discourse. Ho
 wever\, the functions of metadiscourse in spoken texts will depend on the 
 activity type at hand.\n\nGenerally\, it is not possible to classify certa
 in forms as metadiscourse since it is not the form that determines whether
  something is metalinguistic but rather the co-text. Identifying metalangu
 age is difficult due to the vagueness of the boundaries between metalingui
 stic and other functions\, as many utterances are multifunctional (see Sch
 iffrin 1980:201\; Techtmeier 2001:1457\; Ädel 2006:23).\nMetadiscourse ma
 y refer to any level and any aspect of discourse such as channel (e.g. aco
 ustic problems in understanding)\, roles of speaker and listener\, speakin
 g rights and turn-taking\, word meaning\, sentence and utterance meaning\,
  topic of talk\, frames and text types\, conversational maxims\, textual e
 lements\, discourse organisation\, etc. (Bublitz 2001:1332).\n\nThe functi
 ons of metadiscourse can generally be seen in describing\, organising and 
 commenting on the ongoing discourse\, often serving the purpose of achievi
 ng understanding and supporting acceptance (see also Techtmeier’s (2001:
 1454) three basic functions of metacommunicative utterances). Metadiscours
 e can be applied prospectively  and retrospectively  in the process of neg
 otiating and managing understanding (Bublitz 2001:1332). However\, the use
  of metadiscourse has been found to vary substantially across different ge
 nres and different cultures (see Mauranen 1993 and 2010\, Hyland 2005\, Ä
 del 2006\, Penz 2011\, Graf 2015).  These differences are not surprising i
 n view of findings that metadiscourse may provide some insights into under
 lying interactional and pragmatic norms of the language use of a community

DESCRIPTION:Announcing the Computational Construction Grammar and Construc
 tional Change Annual Conference of the Linguistic Society of Belgium in co
 operation with the Evolutionary Linguistics Association\, 8 June 2015\, Vr
 ije Universiteit Brussel\, Belgium\n\nAfter several decades in scientific 
 purgatory\, language evolution has reclaimed its place as one of the most 
 important branches in linguistics\, and it is increasingly recognized as o
 ne of the most crucial sources of evidence for understanding human cogniti
 on. This renewed interest is accompanied by exciting breakthroughs in the 
 science of language. Historical linguists can now couple their expertise t
 o powerful methods for retrieving and documenting which changes have taken
  place. At the same time\, construction grammar is increasingly being embr
 aced in all areas of linguistics as a fruitful way of making sense of all 
 these empirical observations. Construction grammar has also enthused forma
 l and computational linguists\, who have developed sophisticated tools for
  exploring issues in language processing and learning\, and how new forms 
 of grammar may emerge in speech populations.\n\nSeparately\, linguists and
  computational linguists can therefore explain which changes take place in
  language and how these changes are possible. When working together\, howe
 ver\, they can also address the question of why language evolves over time
  and how it emerged in the first place. This year\, the BKL-CBL conference
  therefore brings together top researchers from both fields to put evidenc
 e and methods from both perspectives on the table\, and to take up the cha
 llenge of uniting these efforts.\n\nInvited Speakers:\n\nThe conference co

DESCRIPTION:SemEval 2016: Task 1\nSemantic Textual Similarity (STS)\n\nSem
 antic Textual Similarity (STS) measures the degree of equivalence in the u
 nderlying semantics of paired sentences. While making such an assessment i
 s trivial for humans\, constructing models that mimic human level performa
 nce represents a difficult computational semantics problem.\n\nTo stimulat
 e research in this area and encourage the development of creative new appr
 oaches to modeling sentence level semantics\, the STS shared task has been
  held annually since 2012\, as part of the SemEval/*SEM family of workshop
 s.\n\nTask Definition:\n\nGiven two sentences\, participant models are ask
 ed to produce a similarity score on a scale from 0 to 5\, with 0 indicatin
 g semantic independence and 5 signifying semantic equivalence. Performance
  is assessed by the Pearson correlation between model assigned semantic si

SUMMARY:Space and Identity

DESCRIPTION:The significance of the academic questions raised by the issue
  of space-reference in the last three decades lies in the outcome of a par
 adox that seems to emanate from this given. Identity\, therefore\, is buil
 t on the duality between stability and movement and defined by self-repres
 entation. P. Tap’s definition of the concept of identity\, based on conf
 erring it a set of representations and feelings that may be developed by a
  subject about his/her own self\, is regarded as more accurate than other 
 definitions (P. Tap\, Identités collectives et changements sociaux\, 1986
 ). It means that identity “springs from a voluntary effort continuously 
 made by the subject in order to manage its own continuity and its coherenc
 e in the form of a perpetual change […]” (C. Dubar\, La socialisation:
  construction des identités sociales et professionnelles\, 1991).\n\nA si
 milar approach that translates an urgent need to adjust the subject’s si
 tuation\, as far as his/her identity is concerned\, risks to incite a pers
 istent disorientation on the individual as well as on the collective level
 s. The same initiative can provoke a distortion of the real and the virtua
 l. As a result\, the subject appropriates space in which he/she exists. He
 /she can get into a process of identifying his/her original space as he/sh
 e can immigrate or be exiled in a movement of (un)conscious rupture that c
 an be concretized through virtual reading or social networks.\n\nTaking in
 to consideration the complexity of the paradigm “space and identity”\,
  participants are encouraged to scrutinise and develop diverse approaches.
  The first approach examines present-absent referential space\, its value\
 , its function and its action concerning identity in its different context
 s and epochs. The second considers the relationship of the so-called parad
 igm\, its influences and/or implications and how they enter into a state o
 f play within its composition. These influences may be conscious or uncons
 cious\, positive or negative.\n\nA multidisciplinary reading of diverse do
 mains\, i.e. literary\, linguistic\, psychological\, anthropological and s
 ocial\, allows the essence of the relation “space - identity” to be sc
 rutinized\, and their continuity and discontinuity inherent in the act of 
 adaptation-readaptation and appropriation-reappropriation to be examined. 
 This reading proves to be fundamental at once to self-construction and to 
 acknowledging the other.

 ations\nA one-day Symposium\n\nFriday 10 July 2015\, University of Notting
 ham (UK)\n\nPlenary speaker: Paul Baker (Lancaster University)\n\nRecent r
 esearch in corpus linguistics is pushing the boundaries of the discipline 
 towards more and more interdisciplinary applications. Although used origin
 ally by linguists alone\, CL methods are now being embraced by researchers
  working in an ever-widening range of academic disciplines. Spurred on by 
 growing recognition of the utility of such methods for providing unprecede
 nted and unpredictable insights into how language is used in the real worl
 d\, students and established scholars alike are now adopting CL approaches
  to answer questions in an array of subjects\, including the social scienc
 es\, literary studies\, education\, psychology\, translation studies\, the
  health sciences\, and many\, many more.\n\nThe ''Corpus Linguistics beyon

DESCRIPTION:Improved computational models of semantics hold great promise 
 for applications in language technology\, be it semantics at the lexical l
 evel\, sentence level or discourse level. Large-scale corpora with corresp
 onding annotations (word senses\, propositions\, attributions and discours
 e relations) are making it possible to develop statistical models for many
  tasks and applications. However\, developments in lexical and sentence-le
 vel semantics remain largely distinct from those in discourse semantics. T
 his workshop aims at bridging this gap by bringing together researchers to
  discuss how multiple levels of semantics can be integrated and implemente
 d in various applications. \n\nOur goal is to gather and showcase theoreti
 cal and computational approaches to joint models of semantics\, and applic
 ations that incorporate multi-level semantics. We hope to bring together r
 esearchers from various areas: computational linguistics who strive for mo
 re expressive models of language understanding\, linguists and cognitive s
 cientists interested in aspects of representing text with multiple levels 
 of semantics\, machine learning researchers interested in joint inference 
 over different types of semantic cues\, and also researchers who are inter
 ested in applications that require or will benefit from multi-level semant
 ics. A dialog between researchers has great potential to advance work in e
 ach of these areas and bring about more powerful and enriched models of te
 xt semantics.

SUMMARY:Middle and Early New Indo-Aryan: a crucial period for linguistic d
 evelopment?

DTEND;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20160903T000000

DESCRIPTION:Grammatical constructions in the Old Indo-Aryan period\, with 
 its main exponents of Sanskrit and Vedic\, have been well-known and descri
 bed (cf. Speijer 1886\,  Hock 1991\, Jamison 1983\, Kulikov 2012\, Dahl 20
 10 amongst others). New Indo-Aryan languages are also relatively well-stud
 ied\, in particular with regard to case and agreement patterns. \n\nThe ev
 olution and the realization of the ergative pattern in Indo-Aryan has rece
 ived due attention in general overviews as well as in specific studies (Bu
 tt 2006\, Deo and Sharma 2006\, Hock 1986\, Hook 1991\, Stronski 2009\, Ve
 rbeke and De Cuypere 2009)\, as well as non-canonical subject patterns (Ho
 ok 1990\, Montaut 1996\, Verbeke\, Kulikov and Willems 2015). In such stud
 ies of the development of the languages\, the Late Middle to Early New Ind
 o-Aryan period is considered a transitional period\, during which IA morph
 osyntax has undergone crucial change\, but only few studies exclusively fo
 cus on this stage. For instance\, with regard to the evolution of ergativi
 ty\, Bubeník (1998) has suggested that in Apabhraṃśa\, the shift from 
 an accusative to an ergative alignment pattern occurred\, whereas Khokhlov
 a (1992\, 2000\, 2001\, 2006) argues that this steady drift from an ergati
 ve alignment via so called tripartite alignment to accusative alignment to
 ok place in Old Rajasthani. Montaut (1996\, 2004\, 2006) upholds that the 
 change from a synthetic future to a periphrastic future\, from conjunctive
  to present\, has also happened in this time frame. The objective postposi
 tional case marker of Hindi-Urdu is argued to have originated in this peri
 od\, just like the non-canonical marking of experiencer subjects\, which w
 as absent from earlier stages in the language (Drocco 2008\, Strnad 2013).
  The pronominal system also changed dramatically in this period\, as was s
 hown by Bubenik and Paranjape (1996).\n\nBesides important morphosyntactic
  changes\, this is also the period that the geography of the modern langua
 ges was redrawn. From broad sociolects spoken according to social strata\,
  such as Sanskrit\, Maharasthri Prakrit and Apabhraṃśa (Pollock 2009\, 
 De Clercq 2010) the written language changes to regiolects. The languages 
 diversify and grow closer to the spoken variety. This is the stage where R
 ajasthani splits from Gujarati\, where literary Bengali grows from Magahi 
 Prakrit. In this respect\, studies of lesser-known languages are complemen
 tary to diachronic studies\, as they might reveal possible pathways of lan
 guage change which deviate from the patterns of the better known languages
 . Recent years have seen a rise in studies on these minority languages\, y
 et more is to be done (Liljegren 2008\, Phillips 2014\, Stronski 2014).\n\
 nIn short\, the period knows a tremendous evolution and dynamics. It is a 
 highly informative period to trace grammaticalization processes\, yet exte
 nsive data-based studies have not been undertaken. Stronski\, Tokaj and Ve
 rbeke (SLE 2015) was one of the first steps in the direction to assemble c
 orpus data in order to make well-founded claims on the evolution of constr
 uctions involving non-finte verbal forms  in Early New Indo-Aryan. However
 \, other grammatical patterns could as well benefit by similar undertaking
 s. \n

DESCRIPTION:The aim of the Congress is to forward the reconstruction of th
 e proto-languages of the Niger-Congo constituent families and\, eventually
 \, of the Proto-Niger-Congo language. Data-based communications suggesting
  proto-language reconstructions (phonological\, morphological\, lexical\, 
 syntactical\, semantic…) of various chronological levels or concrete ste

DESCRIPTION:Speech Processing in Realistic Environments  - SPIRE\n9 Januar
 y 2016\, Groningen\, the Netherlands\nIn cooperation with SPIN 2016: http:
 //spin2016.nl and http://inspire-itn.eu/index.php/inspire-events/workshop-
 spin2016\n\nDeadline for submission of abstracts: 20 September 2015\n\nDes
 cription of the workshop:\n\nAlthough listeners often experience more than
  one adverse condition simultaneously (e.g.\, noise and visual distraction
 )\, classical research methods have traditionally only addressed adverse c
 onditions individually. This has contributed to the fragmentation of speec
 h communication research into numerous sub-disciplines that rarely interac
 t. While each type of adverse condition can have important consequences on
  its own\, it is often the combination of conditions that conspires to cre
 ate serious communication problems especially for elderly and hearing-impa
 ired individuals.\n\nIn 2012\, a Marie Curie Initial Training Network call
 ed Investigating Speech Processing in Realistic Environments (INSPIRE) was
  initiated with the aim of creating a community of researchers who can exp
 loit synergies between the sub-disciplines of speech communication. The pu
 rpose of this workshop is to bring together researchers with common intere
 sts in human and automatic speech recognition in challenging conditions of
  real environments (e.g.\, under increased cognitive load\, divided attent
 ion\, environmental noise\, accented speech\, non-native knowledge\, heari
 ng impairment & hearing loss).\n\nTopics of the workshop include\, but are
  not limited to:\n\n- State of the art empirical research on speech percep
 tion in challenging\, realistic listening environments\n- Experimental and
  clinical methods for research in naturalistic speech perception \n- Compu
 tational modeling of speech intelligibility for normal-hearing and hearing
 -impaired listeners under realistic conditions\n- Tools and corpora for te
 sting and comparing speech intelligibility\n- Integration of human auditor
 y processing and machine speech recognition\n\nKeynote Speakers:\n\n- Jona

 conference taking place at the University of Potsdam\, 2-4 December 2014. 
 The exact day of the workshop will be announced. \n\nThe workshop will foc
 us on various aspects of the first language acquisition of syntax in the S
 lavic languages. The workshop pursues a two-­fold goal. On the one and\, 
 it aims to provide a platform for the presentation of acquisition data fro
 m a broad variety of Slavic languages. On the other hand\, it motivates a 
 discussion of the intrinsic properties of the syntax acquisition of the in
 dividual Slavic languages and consequently urges an analysis of the Slavic
  data in a comparative perspective. Generally\, it will be interesting to 
 see what empirical evidence the acquisition data may (or may not) provide 
 for current syntactic theories. L1 Slavic data from monolingual\, multilin
 gual as well as from typical and atypical acquisition may be presented.\n\

DESCRIPTION:Variation is a property of living languages and a fundamental 
 notion in linguistics. Research on variation is centered on discovering th
 e varying forms and structures of linguistic systems\, and aims to deliver
  hypotheses on the factors that determine and constrain the observable phe
 nomena. To this end\, the aim of the workshop is to investigate morphologi
 cal variation affecting units and morphological processes\, which may be t
 riggered by contact with another language\, and/or language-internal prope
 rties. Illustration will be provided with examples drawn from various ling
 uistic systems and also from dialects of the same language. \n\nThe Worksh

DESCRIPTION:The University of Oregon Linguistics Department is pleased to 
 announce a special two-day workshop on innovative methods in linguistic fi
 eldwork. This workshop seeks to examine new approaches to research on less
 er-studied languages and engagement with minority language communities.\n\
 nAfter many successful decades of empirical investigation of language stru
 cture in minority languages\, theoretical\, methodological\, and technolog
 ical advances have opened up new opportunities for enriched fieldwork-base
 d research. This inaugural workshop brings together experts in different a
 spects of field linguistic research\, who will share their work and perspe
 ctives in a series of public talks as well as interactive seminars. These 
 events focus on using GIS mapping techniques in the field (with Kristine H
 ildebrandt\, SIUE)\, investigating variation in minority language communit
 ies (with James Stanford\, Dartmouth)\, and collaboration with local commu
 nities (with Mark Turin\, UBC). \n\nThe program is available on the worksh
 op website (http://blogs.uoregon.edu/owilf/).  The event is free and open 
 to the public.  No registration is necessary for the public talks\, althou
 gh interested participants should contact the organizers to sign up in adv

SUMMARY:Chinese Accents and Accented Chinese

DESCRIPTION:''Chinese Accents and Accented Chinese'' is a platform that se
 eks to explore the phonetics and phonology of second language acquisition 
 in which Chinese is either the native language (L1) or the target language
  (L2).\n \nThe current fast developments in China have led to an increase 
 of the number of Chinese learners of English and other European languages 
 as well as an increase of speakers of European languages learning Chinese.
  This emerging interest in learning and teaching Chinese all over the worl
 d has\, in turn\, increased the demand for qualified phonetic and phonolog
 ical research to support teaching of Chinese as a second language. Also th
 e production and perception of Chinese students of foreign languages incre
 asingly attracts the attention of scholars both within China as overseas. 
 \n\nSince Chinese and European languages greatly differ in their consonant
 s\, vowels\, and prosody—let alone their different writing systems—sec
 ond language acquisition into either direction is a difficult task. Althou
 gh there is a vast amount of literature on Chinese-accented English (discu
 ssing\, for instance\, typical Chinese pronunciations of English\, includi
 ng wrong stress placement)\, research on Chinese accent in other languages
  lags far behind. Similarly\, foreign accented Chinese is hardly linguisti
 cally investigated. Even for Chinese-accented English\, a thorough investi
 gation is still lacking.

DESCRIPTION:Theme and Motivation:\n\nLanguage Technologies in support of L
 ess-Resourced Languages (LRL)\n\nThis Workshop is targeting all stakeholde
 rs somehow involved in Language Technology for less-resourced languages\, 
 either as users\, developers\, researchers\, language activists\, or polic
 y makers. As such\, the Workshop broadly addresses current use and usabili
 ty of Language Technologies for less-resourced languages. This year\, we t
 ake the opportunity of celebrating the 20th anniversary of the Language an
 d Technology Conference to analyze the influence of Language Technologies 
 on Less-Resourced Languages over two decades. We will particularly welcome
  contributions addressing the following issues:\n\n1) Less-resourced langu
 ages in the digital age - how well are regional/minority/less-resourced la
 nguages equipped for the digital age? What is the experience of speakers\,
  what are their opportunities to act in the digital sphere by means of the
 se languages? Do speakers of regional/minority/less-resourced languages ex
 perience any kind of ''unequal digital opportunity''? What is the impact o
 f Language Technology on the use and usability of less-resourced languages
  on digital media and devices? \n\n2) Language Technologies for less-resou
 rced languages - development of Language and Resources technology for less
 -resourced languages is often linked to purposes other than availability o
 f applications for retrieving information or for enabling communication (e
 .g. language learning\, identity-building or language reclamation): how of
 ten are less-resourced languages targeted by applications for educational\
 , entertainment\, or revitalization purposes?\n\n3) Less-resourced languag
 es: charting the field - what do we know about currently available Languag
 e and Resources technologies for less-resourced languages? How to draw a c
 omprehensive and accurate picture? Who are the actors to be involved? What
  is the experience of researchers and developers?\n\n4) Less-resourced lan
 guages: rethinking the BLaRK - the BLaRK (Basic Language Resources Kit) st
 ill proves a useful tool for planning and implementing Language Technology
  for Less-resourced languages. How can it be remodeled/rethought in the li
 ght of current technological development? How can it be channeled into a c
 oherent development roadmap?\n\nImportant Dates:\n\n- Paper Submissions Du
 e: 10 September\, 2015\n- Notification of Acceptance: 1 October 2015\n- Fi
 nal Paper Submission Deadline: 15 October 2015\n- Workshop: 28 November 20

DESCRIPTION:The field of Language Documentation and Description (LDD) has 
 been growing in recent years in Europe\, the Americas\, and Australia. It 
 is\, however\, still in its early stages of development in the Asian regio
 n. The Department of Linguistics of The University of Hong Kong is deeply 
 involved in the study\, analysis and description of languages of East\, So
 uth and Southeast Asia (ESSA). This includes larger\, smaller and endanger
 ed languages\, as well as contact languages.\n\nWith this conference we wa
 nt to focus on a documentary approach to languages of the Asian region. We
  want to discuss and develop new perspectives for the description and docu
 mentation of Asian languages and uses of the resulting data and analyses. 
 As part of our drive to develop documentary linguistics at HKU\, we will h
 ost a 4-day event: the first two days will offer an intensive workshop in 
 LDD training\; the latter two days will be dedicated to a symposium on doc
 umentary linguistics.\n\nGuest Speakers:\n\nMr. L.W\, Kit\, Founder of the
  Dimen/Dong Eco-workshop\, China\nDr. L. Lim\, Founder and director of lin
 guisticminorities.hk\n\nVenue: Hong Kong University Centennial Campus\, Ho
 ng Kong\n\nWorkshop (6-7 April 2016)\n\nThe 2-day workshop will feature 4 
 modules aimed at graduate students\, young practitioners as well as collea
 gues involved in the development of LDD in the region. \n\nTopics include:
 \n\n1. Fundamentals of theory and practice in LDD\n2. Sociolinguistic fiel
 dwork\n3. Roundtable on revitalization\n4. Roundtable on teaching and lear
 ning of LDD\n\nThe workshop will be led by Prof. Peter Austin (SOAS/ HKU) 
 and Prof. Umberto Ansaldo (HKU) with the participation of the following sp
 eakers: \nLee Wai-Kit (Founder of Dimen Dong Eco-museum)\nDr. Lisa Lim (HK

 \nProf. Sumittra Suraratdecha (Mahidol)\n\nSymposium (8-9 April 2016)\n\nT
 he 2-day symposium focuses on the sharing of experiences\, ongoing project
 s and current developments in the field of documentary linguistics in East
 \, Southeast and South Asia especially. Graduate students and early career
  documentarists are particularly welcome to share their work.\n\nThe event
 s are free of charge. Travel awards of modest amounts will be available fo

DESCRIPTION:Organizers: Horst Simon & Christian Forche (Freie Universität
  Berlin)\n\nInvited Speakers:\n\nPeter Auer (Albert-Ludwigs-Universität F
 reiburg)\nHans C. Boas (University of Texas at Austin)\nGreville G. Corbet
 t (University of Surrey)\nGisbert Fanselow (Universität Potsdam)\nOlga Fi
 scher (Universiteit van Amsterdam)\nManfred Krifka (Humboldt-Universität 
 Berlin & ZAS\, Berlin)\n\nWorkshop Description:\n\nOne of the basic operat
 ions in every scientific endeavour is to analyze and then categorize the d
 ata under study. In this workshop we wish to take the opportunity to refle
 ct on this particular activity and its products in linguistic research.\n\
 nA major task of the grammarian is to devise well-defined criteria for cla
 ssification and to come to grips with pieces of data that cannot be easily
  assigned to any category. It may even turn out that a neat (binary) class
 ification is unattainable on principle – researchers emphasizing this po
 int will resort to grammatical models involving prototypes\, blurry bounda
 ries or some other device.\n\nIssues of categorization arise in the analys
 is of all kinds of grammatical elements (albeit not always to the same deg
 ree): e.g. phonological segments\, morphological features\, inflection cla
 sses\, word classes\, clauses\, semantic classes\, etc.\n\nWith this works
 hop\, we wish to instigate conversations about some fundamentals of gramma
 tical research\, involving grammarians working in a variety of research tr
 aditions and in different grammatical models.

DESCRIPTION:Social media is a constant in our life\, influencing the way w
 e think\, interact\, learn\, consolidate relationships and understand soci
 ety. As a result of the rapid worldwide acceptance and usage of social med
 ia\, more and more content is becoming available as each day passes. Both 
 because of its importance and its increasing volume\, it is not surprising
  that information from Social Media is rapidly becoming an essential sourc
 e for natural language processing (NLP) research.\n\nAt the same time\, Li
 nked Data is emerging as an increasingly important topic for NLP. Work in 
 the field has produced massive amounts of linguistic data\, including anno
 tated corpora\, lexicons\, databases\, and ontologies\, in formats that en
 able their exploitation in the Semantic Web. Linking the contents of these
  resources to each other as well as to common ontologies can enable access
  to and discovery of detailed linguistic information and could foster a ma
 jor leap forward in NLP research and development.\n\nRUMOUR-2015 aims to g
 ather innovative approaches for exploitation of social media using semanti
 c web technologies and linked data by bringing together research on the Se
 mantic Web\, Linked Data\, and the Social Sciences. The workshop will brin
 g together practitioners\, researchers\, and scholars to share examples\, 
 cases\, theories\, and analysis of social media and linked data in order t
 o address the intersection among these areas. This intersection includes n
 ot only the challenges of problems such as the understanding and acting up
 on large-scale data of different kinds\, provenance\, and reliability\, bu
 t also the use of these media for crisis management\, which involves issue
 s of credibility\, accountability\, trustworthiness\, privacy\, authentici
 ty\, and provision of provenance information.\n\nThe workshop is part of E
 UROLAN-2015 Summer School (the 12th in the series of EUROLAN schools)\, wh
 ich will provide a comprehensive overview of Linguistic Linked Open Data\,
  including introduction to formalisms for representing linguistic resource
 s\, extracting and integrating knowledge from text\, semi-structured and b
 adly structured data\, ontologies and reasoning\, exploitation of big data
  using semantic web query languages\, reasoning capabilities and much more
 .\n\nVenue:\n\nThe Workshop on Social Media and the Web of Linked Data wil
 l be held Saturday\, 18 July 2015\, in Sibiu\, Romania. RUMOUR-2015 will b
 e a satellite event of EUROLAN-2015\, the Summer School on Linguistic Link
 ed Open Data\, an event that will last two weeks\, between 13 and 25 July 
 2015.\n\nIn addition to the excellence of its academic program\, the EUROL
 AN sequence of summer schools is well known for the camaraderie among prof
 essors and students\, who may enjoy common activities and social events du
 ring dinners and later in the evenings\, as well as an excursion in the mi
 ddle school weekend.\n\nSibiu is a wonderful city of art and culture\, pla
 ced in the middle of Transylvania (a Romanian province being known before 
 by Germans as Siebenbürgen and by Hungarians as Erdély)\, who has preser
 ved its Medieval flavour. Former European capital of culture in 2007\, Sib
 iu has an attractive and stimulating atmosphere. With its rich range of re
 staurants\, pavement cafes and beer gardens\, Sibiu is a city easy to expl
 ore on foot\, inspiring social and scientific networking.

DESCRIPTION:Le Département de Philologie Française et Romane et l'Instit
 ut de Ciències de l'Educació (ICE) de l'Université Autonome de Barcelon
 e (UAB) organisent les prochaines Journées Pédagogiques sur l'Enseigneme
 nt du Français en Espagne les 7\, 8 et 9 septembre 2015 à la Faculté de
 s Lettres de l'UAB sur le campus de Bellaterra.\n\nLes Journées sont ouve
 rtes à tous les enseignants de français quel que soit leur niveau d'ense
 ignement et le pays où ils enseignent. Les étudiants se destinant à l'e
 nseignement du français sont également admis. Les conférences\, communi
 cations et présentations d'expériences pédagogiques concerneront la th
 ématique suivante :\n\n« Oralité\, enseignement du Français et systèm
 es éducatifs plurilingues''.\n\nIl est prévu que cette thématique se d
 écline sur trois niveaux :\n\n- Culturel  (liens entre cultures de langue
  française et cultures de langues espagnoles)\n- Linguistique française 
 et linguistique appliquée  (recherches récentes sur l'oralité et l'ense
 ignement et évaluation des manifestations phoniques du français\, mais a
 ussi sur le rôle du français dans la société actuelle)\n- Psychopédag
 ogique et didactique(expériences et pratiques pédagogiques en particulie
 r sur l'oral à tous les niveaux d'enseignement).\n\nL'organisation de ces
  Journées s'inscrit dans un contexte bien particulier. La connaissance de
  langues étrangères est devenue une composante incontournable du profil 
 du citoyen du XXIe siècle et la formation de citoyens plurilingues\, en p
 articulier en Europe\, est d'ailleurs officiellement prônée par l'Union 
 Européenne. Dans cette perspective\, il est indiscutable que la dimension
  européenne que l'on entend développer ne peut pas faire l'impasse sur l
 a langue et les cultures de langue française\, et l'enseignement des lang
 ues dans les systèmes éducatifs ne peut pas ne pas inclure le français.
 \n\nLa société semble prendre conscience de cette exigence (il n'est pas
  exceptionnel que ce soit bien souvent les meilleurs élèves qui s'inscri
 vent aux cours de français) et des initiatives institutionnelles récente
 s originales comme la double certification espagnole et française Bachill
 erato + Baccalauréat se développent et connaissent un franc succès. Un 
 sous-thème des Journées concernera précisément la problématique de l'
 oral dans ces formations plurilingues (voir programme).\n\nLa situation ac
 tuelle permet ainsi d'augurer un regain d'intérêt pour l'enseignement du
  français. Les événements récents ont d'ailleurs montré que la connai
 ssance de la langue française et des cultures de langue française par le
 s jeunes non seulement répond aux orientations de l'U.E.\, mais peut cont
 ribuer efficacement à l'émergence d'une société qui se veuille toléra
 nte et enrichie par la « connaissance de l'autre ». Dans cette perspecti
 ve\, les enseignants de français peuvent -- nous pouvons -- jouer un rôl
 e important dans la formation du citoyen européen. Ces Journées Pédagog
 iques se veulent une contribution forte à cette action.\n\nPour les inscr
 iptions\, prière de remplir le formulaire indiqué sous l'onglet « Inscr
 iption » du site http://ice.uab.cat/frances15/presentacio.php. Pour tout

DESCRIPTION:The research network Hip Hop in Finland: Genres and Generation
 s invites scholars to the interdisciplinary\, international conference Hip
  Hop Studies: North and South to be held in Helsinki\, Finland on 19-20 No
 vember 2015.\n\nAs hip hop scholarship continues to develop its analysis o
 f increasingly diverse and dynamic cultural forms\, this conference will c
 elebrate and critically examine hip hop in its geographic\, cultural\, ide
 ological\, and musical multiplicities. Embracing a consciously global focu
 s which will allow for in-depth and comparative analyses of hip hop’s ma
 ny contrary currents\, this conference will highlight new research on hip 
 hop by scholars in the Nordic countries\, and seek to build dialogue with 
 scholars from the rest of Europe\, Asia\, Africa\, and the Americas.\n\nTh
 e keynote speaker will be Murray Forman (Northeastern University\, USA). T
 he conference will also include a plenary session with leading Nordic hip 
 hop scholars Mads Krogh (Aarhus University\, Denmark) and Johan Söderman

DESCRIPTION:International Conference\nSapienza Università di Roma & Unive
 rsità degli Studi di Roma Tre\nRome\, 11-13 February 2016\n\nGiven the en
 ormous and ever-increasing impact of audiovisual products on the general p
 ublic\, the representations that audiovisual texts convey of other languag
 es and cultures cannot be underestimated. Films have been chief players in
  the construction of linguistic and cultural identities (Kozloff 2000\, Bl
 eichenbacher 2008)\, which is always the result of an act of selection of 
 traits and features\, both visual and verbal. Their critical role in reinf
 orcing negative stereotypes has not been overlooked by scholars (Lippi-Gre
 en 1997)\, and so has the role of technical and ideological manipulation i
 n shaping audiovisual texts and their translation (Díaz-Cintas 2012)\, wh
 ile the creative\, positive role of films in constructing images of other 
 languages and cultures has been comparatively neglected by research\, as h
 as the similar role played by audiovisual products other than cinematograp
 hic films.\n\nThe translation process is a further step in the direction o
 f shaping representation. As Venuti (1998) points out\, “[t]ranslation w
 ields enormous power in constructing representations of foreign cultures
 ” and translated audiovisual texts in particular have the power “to pr
 oduce insights into the cultures and languages represented” (Guillot 201
 2)\, to add further layers of meanings and to create new webs of associati
 ons only alluded to\, if not altogether missing\, in the original texts. S
 tudies conducted on dubbing and subtitling have shown the mimetic capacity
  of some linguistic features to convey pragmatic meaning and sociolinguist
 ic variation in both source and target languages (Pavesi 2009). Particular
  emphasis has been placed on audiovisual translation as a site of represen
 tational practice (Pérez-González 2014)\, on the representations that tr
 anslations convey\, on their serving as “a locus for (re)-negotiations o
 f individual and group identities”\, “as a vehicle promoting crosscult
 ural and cross-linguistic sensitivity”\, and “as agents of hybridisati
 on of communicative practices” (Guillot 2012). The linguistic resources 
 employed by translators in the representation of language varieties and co
 mmunicative practices have also been an area of increased scholarly intere
 st (Brumme and Espunya 2012).\n\nThis conference aims to explore the expre
 ssive and representational potential of the interplay of words\, images\, 
 sounds and silences on the screen focussing on the negotiation of identity
  in audiovisual texts\, and\, more generally\, on audiovisual translation 
 as a mode of intercultural exchange. Linguistic and cultural representatio
 n will be ideally investigated from various viewpoints: that of the power 
 of script-writers and translators to create\, reinforce or undermine assum
 ptions about the foreign language and culture represented\; that of the au
 diences who negotiate the representations and meanings conveyed by audiovi
 sual texts\; that of stylistic and generic conventions\, which contribute 
 to shaping cultural and linguistic representation via established features
  and topoi in both source and target texts\; and that of participatory tra
 nslation practices\, which are playing an important role in challenging an
 d reshaping established representational schemas and conventions.\n\nConfe

DESCRIPTION:The Centre for Translation & Interpreting Studies in Scotland 
 (CTISS) is honoured to be hosting the 8th Critical Link International Conf
 erence. The conference will bring together all community/public service in
 terpreting and translation stakeholders: community and public sector repre
 sentatives\, employers\, developers of tools and technologies\, policy mak
 ers\, practitioners\, professional bodies\, researchers\, service users\, 
 trainers and educators\, TICS (translation\, interpreting & communication 
 support) service providers\, and other interested parties to build on prog
 ress made to date in order to move forward.\n\nThe overarching theme of th
 e conference is Critical LinkS – a new generation. The aim is to explore
  future-proofing community/public service Interpreting and translating: to
  investigate working together across professional\, geographic\, user-grou
 p and language communities (spoken and signed)\, through technology\, and 
 coping with current and emerging constraints (e.g. economic\, environmenta
 l\, geographic\, legal\, linguistic\, social...). The conference will expl
 ore policy\, practice\, pedagogy\, price\, plus innovation in the field.\n
 \nThe Critical Link International Conference series will celebrate its com
 ing of age in Edinburgh\, as the first conference took place 21 years earl
 ier\, in Canada\, in June 1995. Held every three years\, this highly estee
 med event creates a global platform for TICS practitioners\, user groups\,
  public sector professionals\, decision makers\, academics and researchers
 . Providing a forum for the exchange of information\, knowledge and skills
 \, it offers unparalleled opportunities for networking for people from aro
 und the world.\n\nThe first conference examined challenges facing interpre
 ting in the social\, legal and healthcare sectors and began the process of
  identifying responses to those challenges. Navigating today's landscape o
 f extraordinary globalisation\, migration\, austerity and technological ad
 vances\, Critical Link 8 will continue this journey.\n\nThe event will tak
 e place at Heriot-Watt University's Edinburgh Campus. Edinburgh\, capital 
 city of Scotland and the world's festival capital\, offers a wealth of exp
 eriences for visitors to explore from architecture to zoology\, as well as
  offering easy access to other Scottish cities\, tourist destinations and 
 scenic landscapes.\n\nPre-conference workshops and demonstrations will als
 o be scheduled on 27-28 June 2016. In addition\, the Edinburgh Interpretin
 g Research Summer School (EIRSS) will take place at Heriot-Watt just after
  the conference\, 4-8 July 2016.\n\nIn 2005\, the Centre for Translation &
  Interpreting Studies (CTISS)\, housed in the Department of Languages & In
 tercultural Studies (LINCS) established almost fifty years ago\, ran the f
 irst PSIT Conference\, Breaking Down Barriers - A Team Effort. This was th
 e first international conference on public service interpreting & translat
 ing held in Scotland. People still talk about their memories of that confe
 rence and\, not least\, the ceilidh!\n\nIn 2016\, CTISS hopes to welcome p
 eople from every country in the world to participate in Critical Link 8.\n

DESCRIPTION:After several decades in scientific purgatory\, language evolu
 tion has reclaimed its place as one of the most important branches in ling
 uistics\, and it is increasingly recognized as one of the most crucial sou
 rces of evidence for understanding human cognition. This renewed interest 
 is accompanied by exciting breakthroughs in the science of language. Histo
 rical linguists can now couple their expertise to powerful methods for ret
 rieving and documenting which changes have taken place. At the same time\,
  construction grammar is increasingly being embraced in all areas of lingu
 istics as a fruitful way of making sense of all these empirical observatio
 ns. Construction grammar has also enthused formal and computational lingui
 sts\, who have developed sophisticated tools for exploring issues in langu
 age processing and learning\, and how new forms of grammar may emerge in s
 peech populations.\n\nSeparately\, linguists and computational linguists c
 an therefore explain which changes take place in language and how these ch
 anges are possible. When working together\, however\, they can also addres
 s the question of why language evolves over time and how it emerged in the
  first place. This year\, the BKL-CBL conference therefore brings together
  top researchers from both fields to put evidence and methods from both pe
 rspectives on the table\, and to take up the challenge of uniting these ef
 forts.\n\nThe conference contains presentations by 5 different keynote spe
 akers.\n\n- Graeme Trousdale (University of Edinburgh)\n- Luc Steels (VUB/

 glad to invite you to the NooJ 2016 International Conference held in Česk
 é Budějovice (Czech Republic)\, 9-11 June 2016.\n\nNooJ is both a corpus
  processing tool and a linguistic development environment that allows ling
 uists to formalize several levels of linguistic phenomena:\n\n- Typography
  and spelling\n- Syllabification\, phonemic and prosodic transcription\n- 
 Lexicons of simple words\, multiword units\, and discontinuous expressions
 \n- Inflectional\, derivational and agglutinative morphology\n- Local and 
 structural syntax\n- Transformational syntax and paraphrase generation\n- 
 Semantic analysis and machine translation\n\nNooJ provides linguists with 
 regular grammars\, context-free grammars\, context-sensitive grammars\, an
 d unrestricted grammars as well as their graphical equivalent (finite-stat
 e\, recursive and contextual graphs) to facilitate the description of each
  phenomenon. NooJ’s multi-layer approach allows linguists to accumulate 
 elementary descriptions and describe phenomena that cross linguistic level
 s. As a corpus processing tool\, NooJ allows users to apply sophisticated 
 linguistic queries to large corpora in real time\, in order to construct i
 ndices and concordances\, annotate texts automatically\, and perform seman
 tic and statistical analyses\, etc.\n\nNooJ is open-source\, freely availa
 ble at www.nooj4nlp.net\, and over 20 linguistic modules can already be fr
 eely downloaded\, as well as a manual\, video tutorials\, references\, etc
 .\n\nThe NooJ conference intends to:\n\n- Give NooJ users and researchers 
 in Linguistics and in Computational Linguistics the opportunity to meet an
 d share their experience as developers\, researchers and teachers\n- Prese
 nt to NooJ users the latest linguistic resources and NLP applications deve
 loped for/with NooJ\, its latest functionalities\, as well as its future d
 evelopments\n- Offer researchers and graduate students two tutorials (one 
 basic and one advanced) to help them parse corpora and build NLP applicati

 us (University of Tilburg\, the Netherlands)\nCristina Flores (University

 n Unsworth (Radboud University\, the Netherlands)\n \nHeritage language bi
 linguals are typically either first language learners of an immigrant\, mi
 nority language spoken in the home or are simultaneous bilinguals of the 
 “home” language along side the societal majority language in the paren
 ts’/community’s host country. Typically\, around school age\, heritage
  language input is significantly reduced\, as they gradually shift in domi
 nance towards the majority societal language.  Research has shown that the
  outcomes of heritage language acquisition are often significantly differe
 nt from monolingual peers\, for reasons that are not entirely clear (see e
 .g. Montrul\, in press for extensive review). Among the contributory facto
 rs that give rise to heritage speaker differences in developmental sequenc
 e and ultimate attainment are differences in the input—quality and quant
 ity—they receive as compared to monolinguals.  A major contributor to in
 put differences is likely cross-generational attrition\, that is\, L1 attr
 ition from the older generations of immigrants who provide the primary lin
 guistic data to heritage speakers (cf. Sorace 2004\; Rothman 2007).  This 
 is the second seminar in the ESRC seminar series. Our theme relates to des

DESCRIPTION:Le Cours de Linguistique Generale. 1916-2016. L'EMERGENCE\n\nC
 ’est à l’Université de Genève que Ferdinand de Saussure a professé
  les cours de linguistique générale. On sait qu’il a développé\, dè
 s les conférences de 1891 et auparavant à Paris\, des pans de ses idées
  selon les besoins des différents cours qu’il donnait sur les langues a
 nciennes. Entre 1907 et 1911\, ses étudiants ont pu assister à des cours
  spécifiquement dédiés à une présentation de la linguistique généra
 le – telle qu’il la concevait. Ils ne s’y sont pas trompés puisque 
 ce sont eux qui ont réagi les premiers à la mort du maître\, et se sont
  assurés que le contenu élaboré dans les leçons qu’ils avaient suivi
 es ne soit pas perdu. Le Cours de Linguistique Générale est le résultat
  de cette entreprise destinée à perpétuer et transmettre cet héritage.
 \n\nLe colloque de Genève est consacré à l’émergence du CLG. Ses tro
 is sessions parallèles abordent l’ouvrage sous trois angles différents
  et complémentaires. Ses ateliers « libres » lui permettront aussi de s
 ’ouvrir à d’autres perspectives.\n\nTout d’abord il faut traiter de
  la manière dont le livre publié par Bally et Sechehaye a été conçu a
 vec ce que cela suppose comme choix: sélection du contenu\, organisation 
 de la pensée\, décisions quant au développement à accorder aux idées 
 consignées dans les cahiers d’étudiants et dans les notes de Saussure 
 lui-même. Depuis un demi-siècle\, beaucoup de chemin a été parcouru: l
 es travaux d’Engler et de De Mauro\, prolongés par l’immense entrepri
 se - encore en cours - de présentation et d’exploitation des différent
 es sources\, ont permis de mieux appréhender cette genèse.\n\nEnsuite\, 
 conformément aux circonstances qui l’ont vu naître et comme son titre 
 l’indique\, le Cours de Linguistique Générale est un cours – en d’
 autres termes\, un enseignement. Or\, on le sait\, ce manuel n’est pas l
 e reflet de la réalité de la classe\, des classes devrait-on dire. Il fa
 ut s’interroger sur l’aspect didactique de l’entreprise saussurienne
  originelle\, sur sa transcription dans un manuel destiné à transmettre 
 la connaissances - conçu par Bally et Sechehaye. Ceci explique le caract
 ère didactique du Cours du point de vue de l’organisation des leçons o
 ù alternent moments d’explications plus élémentaires et moments d’a
 pprofondissement technique\, repris par la publication\; on n’oubliera p
 as que cet ouvrage représente un archétype de manuel pour la linguistiqu
 e et les sciences humaines.\n\nEnfin\, le volet suivant s’attachera à l
 ’histoire critique des traductions qui ont permis la diffusion internati
 onale de l’ouvrage et de ses positions\, en portant une attention partic
 ulière à la traduction de la terminologie saussurienne. Si les traductio
 ns du CLG ont bien entendu eu un rôle très important dans la diffusion u
 ltérieure du discours genevois\, il faut se souvenir que c’est au trave
 rs d’éditions bilingues comprenant non seulement la transcription des c
 ahiers de certains étudiants mais aussi et simultanément leur traduction
  que l’on a pu se faire une image plus proche de la réalité du moment.
  Cet aspect de la recherche philologique des origines du CLG se doublait a
 ussitôt d’une visée de diffusion internationale.

SUMMARY:Does National Identity Influence Learner Attitudes Towards English
  Language Education?

DESCRIPTION:The patriotism-nationalism distinction has been established as
  an etic aspect of national attitudes among certain nations. In order to u
 nderstand how individual students will acquire a foreign language\, one ha
 s to appreciate the emic characteristics that form national identity to be
  able to discuss the effects of these attitudes on English education. In J
 apan\, one may curiously ask the question\, why is it that Japan ranks as 
 one of the lowest in TOEIC tests in comparison to other less developed cou
 ntries\; where students appear to have less adequate access to education\,
  than Japanese students?  Why is it that despite the six-year compulsory E
 nglish education\, as required by the Ministry of Education\, Japanese stu
 dents still fair amongst the lowest in TOEIC tests? In order to understand
  the influence of the Japanese national identity on English learning\, one
  must appreciate the history of the introduction of the West and subsequen
 tly the English language in Japan. This would undoubtedly be the case for 
 all countries where English was introduced and the general perception of t
 he English language by citizens in those countries\; for instance whether 
 it is considered a hindrance or a tool for social or economic development.
  It has been asserted that attitude to the target language is understood a
 s one of the essential elements influencing the course of one's language l
 earning. If this the case how does Japan's history and its national identi
 ty\, effect English education? This presentation intends to introduce idea
 s in an area\, which lacks substantial studies\, by suggesting a future re
 search topic regarding the influence of national identity on English langu
 age education and the correlation between attitudes and grades obtained by
  Japanese students.

DESCRIPTION:A colloquium concerning the status of the Sociology of Languag
 e and Religion subdiscipline.\n\nSociolinguistics has tended to neglect re
 ligion\, reports of whose death have been greatly exaggerated.  From state
  religions to marginal cults\, violent fundamentalism to commodified spiri
 tuality – religion in its multifarious social formations continues to mo
 rph and even thrive in this era of globalization and digitization.  Althou
 gh several major figures in the field (e.g.\, David Crystal\, Charles Ferg
 uson) made contributions early on\, it was only in the early 2000's that a
  group of researchers focused attention in a concerted way on the topic.  
 That effort resulted in the volume Explorations in the Sociology of Langua
 ge and Religion (2006)\, which included Joshua Fishman’s foundational 
 “Decalogue of Basic Theoretical Perspectives for a Sociology of Language
  and Religion” (13-25). The past decade has seen further conference sess
 ions and publications\, as well as the development of a research network a
 nd website (sociologyoflanguageandreligion.com).  Yet\, much remains to be
  done.  For one thing\, potentially valuable theoretical resources in reli
 gious studies and the sociology of religion have yet to be tapped.\n\nThis
  panel returns to Fishman’s ‘decalogue’ in order to take stock of th
 e current situation.  Fishman himself acknowledged the provisional nature 
 of his contribution\, noting that his ten propositions “need to be flesh
 ed out\, modified\, selectively abandoned or added to in order that a theo
 retically anchored and empirically supported sociology of language and rel
 igion can ultimately develop” (2006: 24).  Drawing on a range of languag
 e practices and cultural areas\, panelists will directly engage one or mor
 e of Fishman’s theoretical principles with the twofold goal of consolida
 ting achievements to date and articulating a new-and-improved (though stil
 l\, of course\, contingent and corrigible) conceptual framework for the so
 ciology of language and religion.

DESCRIPTION:Markers of modal displacement in natural language are used to 
 introduce\, discuss\, assess and manipulate possible scenarios. Until rela
 tively recently\, work on the semantics of modality had concentrated on th
 e verbal domain\, and in particular on modal auxiliaries. However\, over t
 he last years\, there has been an increased interest in the expression of 
 modality across categories. Some recent developments that illustrate that 
 interest are:\n\n- A body of research on modal markers at the DP level has
  emerged\, including work on modified numerals like at least n or at most 
 n (see\, e.g.\, Büring 2008\; Geurts and Nouwen 2007\; Nouwen 2010\; Schw
 arz 2011\; Coppock and Brochhagen 2013)\, free relatives of the whatever-t
 ype (for instance\, Rawlins 2008\, forthcoming\; Dayal 1997\; von Fintel 2
 000\; Condoravdi 2005\, forthcoming\; Tredinnick 2005\; Heller and Wolter 
 2011)\, too constructions (Heim 2000\; Meier 2003\; Hacquard 2000)\, infin
 itival relative clauses as in the man to fix the sink (Bhatt 1999\; Hackl 
 and Nissenbaum 2012)\, modal adjectives (e.g.\, Larson 2000\; Schwarz 2006
 \; Abusch and Rooth 1997\; Romero 2010)\, adnominal conditionals as in the
  price if you pay now (Lasersohn 1996\; Frana forthcoming)\, and modal ind
 efinites (e.g.\, Aloni and Port 2010\; Chierchia 2013\; Fălăuş 2009\, 2
 014\, Giannakidou and Quer 2013\; Alonso-Ovalle and Menéndez-Benito 2008\
 , 2010\, 2011\, among many others).\n\n- There is a growing line of resear
 ch that explores connections between modal auxiliaries and adjectives\, be
 aring on the issue of how gradability is expressed in the modal domain (se
 e\, e.g.\, Lassiter 2011\; Klecha 2014\; Portner and Rubinstein 2014).\n\n
 - Recently\, some work (Hacquard 2013\, forthcoming) has started to invest
 igate the source of the differences between grammatical modal markers (e.g
 .\, modal auxiliaries) and lexical modal markers (e.g.\, verbs like seem o
 r adjectives like likely). Relevant to this issue is recent research on ve
 rbs – like want or try— that are at the border between attitude verbs 
 and modals (see\, among others\, Rubinstein 2012\; Grano 2012\; Sharvit 20
 03).\n\nInvited Speakers:\n\nValentine Hacquard (University of Maryland)\n

DESCRIPTION:Proposal of organization of a colloquium on swearing for the 2
 1st edition of the Sociolinguistics Symposium.\n\nSociolinguistics Symposi
 a represent some of the most exciting and anticipated conferences for soci
 olinguists in Europe. They have existed for more than 40 years now\, and s
 tand out as important meeting points for scholars around the globe. Many o
 f these scholars have come to associate the Sociolinguistics Symposium as 
 a host for recurring thematic panels\, such as the panels dedicated to swe
 aring at the 18th Sociolinguistics Symposium in Southampton (2010)\, and t
 he 19th Sociolinguistics Symposium in Berlin (2012). To many\, it was a co
 nsiderable disappointment that no panel on swearing was featured in the 20
 th Sociolinguistics Symposium (2014).\n\nIn order to continue to promote s
 wearing research activity as well as the tradition of gathering swearing s
 cholars at the Sociolinguistics Symposia\, we propose a colloquium dedicat
 ed to research on swearing for SS21\, the theme of which\, Language and Pr
 estige\, is particularly well-suited to research on swearing. Indeed\, the
  use of swear words is often perceived as something decidedly not prestigi
 ous\, a linguistic behavior generally viewed negatively and explicitly avo
 ided by many who do not wish to be judged as lazy and uneducated speakers 
 (Hirsch\, 1985). To swear is to deviate from a prestigious ''norm''. On th
 e other hand\, swearing often awards speakers covert prestige when it’s 
 recognized as a way to signal or acknowledge in-group membership. In certa
 in communities\, swearing is even understood as a way to express authority
  (Wilson\, 2011 \; Stapleton\, 2010)\; it is then considered a positive an
 d beneficial aspect of language. Swearing can thus actively establish or i
 ndex one's position in a social hierarchy. This is just one of many sociol
 inguistic indexes or pragmatic functions associated with swearing\, and as
  such\, swearing can be analyzed with different tools and from different p
 erspectives.\n\nContact Information:\n\nmichael.gauthier@univ-lyon2.fr\nju

DESCRIPTION:The Language\, Culture and Mind conference series provides an 
 international and interdisciplinary forum for the integration of biologica
 l\, cognitive\, social and cultural perspectives in theoretical and empiri
 cal studies of language and communication. \n\nThe LCM Mission Statement:\
 n\nHuman natural languages are biologically based\, cognitively motivated\
 , affectively rich\, socially shared\, grammatically organized symbolic sy
 stems. They provide the principal semiotic means for the complexity and di
 versity of human cultural life. As has long been recognized\, no single di
 scipline or methodology is sufficient to capture all the dimensions of thi
 s complex and multifaceted phenomenon\, which lies at the heart of what it
  is to be human. In the recent past\, perception and cognition have been t
 he basis of general unifying models of language and language activity. How
 ever\, a genuine integrative perspective must also incorporate the intersu
 bjective dimension of cultural symbols\, cultural norms and cultural pract
 ices. LCM conferences articulate and discuss approaches to diverse genres 
 of language activity which aim to understand their cultural\, social\, cog
 nitive and bodily foundations.\n\nLCM conferences welcome contributions fr
 om scholars and scientists in anthropology\, biology\, linguistics\, philo
 sophy\, psychology\, semiotics\, semantics\, discourse analysis\, cognitiv
 e and neuroscience\, and from other disciplines\, who wish both to impart 
 their insights and findings\, and learn from other disciplines.\n\nTopics 
 include but are not limited to:\n\n- Biological and Cultural Co-Evolution\
 n- Comparative Study of Communication Systems\n- Cognitive and Cultural Sc
 hematization in Language\n- Emergence of Language in Ontogeny and Phylogen
 y\n- Language in Multi-Modal Communication\n- Language and Normativity\n- 
 Language and Thought\, Emotion and Consciousness\n	\nEach LCM conference i
 s organized around a special theme that is reflected in the contributions 
 of plenary speakers\, and focused in two round table discussions. The them
 es are not intended to limit the topics of conference presentations\, but 
 to give each conference a distinctive feel and to provoke focused interdis
 ciplinary debate. \n\nThe theme for LCM 7 at Hunan University is: Signs of
  Life: Cultural contact—change and continuity in language\, thought and 
 identity\n\nThere will be two round table subthemes:\n\n1. Diversity\, end
 angerment\, revitalization of cultures and languages.\n2. Intercultural an
 d transcultural dynamics.\n\nPlenary Speakers: to be announced\n\nThe LCM 
 International Organizing Committee:\n\n- Roberto Bottini\, Center for Mind

DESCRIPTION:Rich Agreement Hypothesis Revisited: morphological effects on 
 word order from a typological and a diachronic perspective.\nOrganizers: T
 hórhallur Eythórsson/Hans-Martin Gärtner/Tonjes Veenstra (Reykjavik/B
 udapest/Berlin).\nWorkshop at the annual DGfS conference\, University of K
 onstanz.\n\nInvited speakers (to be confirmed):\n\nOlaf Koeneman (Nijmegen
 )/Hedde Zeijlstra (Göttingen)\n\nThe overall topic of this workshop is to
  re-examine the relation between inflectional morphology and word order\, 
 and how changes in the morphological component lead to changes in the synt
 actic component\, and vice versa. It will be considered from a typological
  and a diachronic perspective\, with particular emphasis on language conta
 ct and creolization. There is a long-standing tradition in historical ling
 uistics from Meillet (1908) onwards attributing syntactic change to the lo
 ss of inflectional morphology (e.g. Jespersen 1922\, Lightfoot 1979\, Weer
 man 1989). In a specific case\, this line of research has been formalized 
 in the last decades as the Rich Agreement Hypothesis (RAH: Holmberg & Plat
 zack 1991\, Roberts 1993\, Rohrbacher 1994\, Vikner 1995\, Bobaljik & Thr
 áinsson 1998). The discussion has centered on the question whether the co
 rrelation is bi-directional or mono-directional. The strong bi-directional
  version of the RAH has recently been resurrected by Koeneman & Zeijlstra 
 (2014)\, based on the micro-variation within Germanic and Romance language
 s\, but with strong typological claims that go beyond these particular lan
 guage families: on this version of the RAH\, there are no languages that h
 ave rich inflection but not V-to-I\, and no languages that lack rich infle
 ction but still have V-to-I. Although well-known exceptions seem to abound
 \, these have neither been properly catalogued\, nor tested\, let alone ac
 counted for.\n\nThe main goal of this workshop\, therefore\, is to create 
 a platform to stimulate a structured discussion of the well-defined claims
  on the correlation between morphology and word order\, on the basis of di
 achronic data and creole data. As to the diachronic evidence\, there seems
 \, for example\, to be a time lag in the loss of inflectional morphology a
 nd the disappearance of V-to-I in Scandinavian languages (cf. Sundquist 20
 02)\, which begs the question how much time is required between the trigge
 r of the change and its syntactic manifestation. As to the creole language
 s\, some of them seem to exhibit V-movement although they do not have rich
  agreement\, whereas others potentially count as having rich agreement but
  no V-movement (cf. Baptista 2002\, McWhorter 2013\, Roberts 1999\, Veenst
 ra 1996\, 2008).\n\nThe topics to be addressed include:\n\n(i) When does t
 he verbal and/or pronominal (subject clitic) paradigm count as having RA\,
  and are these subtypes of RA independent of\, or interdependent on\, each
  other?\n(ii) How long can the time lag between different diachronic stage
 s be\, in order to still be able to speak of a causal relation of morpholo
 gy and syntax between such stages?\n(iii) Can language contact account for
  apparent exceptions to the RAH?\n(iv) What is the typological and histori
 cal evidence bearing on the RAH outside of modern Germanic and Romance\, i
 n particular in creole languages\, and how is it to be interpreted?\n\nThe
  workshop will bring together scholars from theoretical linguistics\, hist
 orical linguistics\, creole studies and language contact studies to addres
 s the above issues.

DESCRIPTION:Sprachgebrauch kommt ohne Routinen und ohne Rückgriff auf vor
 geprägte Muster nicht aus. Die im Sprachsystem angelegten Möglichkeiten 
 der Kombination sprachlicher Einheiten werden im Gebrauch zum einen nur an
 satzweise ausgeschöpft und unterliegen zum anderen häufig auch nicht sys
 tematisch erfassbaren Restriktionen. Neuere sprachtheoretische Ansätze wi
 e etwa konstruktionsgrammatische Zugänge oder die Perspektive sprachliche
 r Prägungen stellen denn auch solche verfestigten Muster\, angefangen bei
  idiomatischen Wortverbindungen über Kollokationen bis hin zu syntaktisch
 en Schemata\, geradezu ins Zentrum ihrer Betrachtungen. Grundlegend pragma
 tisch ist der Blick auf verfestigte Muster in zweifacher Hinsicht: Erstens
  entstehen sie im Gebrauch und sind als Ergebnisse von Routinisierungsproz
 essen zu beschreiben\; zweitens sind sie als Einheiten mit übersummativer
  Qualität häufig nur unter Verweis auf ihre typischen Gebrauchskontexte 
 hinreichend zu erfassen. Mithin bieten sich insbesondere korpusanalytische
  Methoden an\, um Verfestigungen (als Prozess) und Verfestigtes (als Produ
 kt) empirisch beschreibbar zu machen.\n\nWährend in neueren sprachtheoret
 isch-pragmatischen Ansätzen insgesamt ein zunehmendes Inte­resse an Verf
 estigungen auf verschiedenen sprachlichen Ebenen spürbar ist\, haben sich
  umgekehrt auch in der Phraseologie pragmatische Beschreibungsansätze eta
 bliert. Die For­schungen zu pragmatischen Phraseologismen wie Routineform
 eln oder Phrasemkonstruktionen sind hier ebenso zu nennen wie die Arbeiten
  zur Funktionalität von Phraseologismen in verschiedenen Text­sorten und
  Kommunikationsbereichen. Zudem kommen über korpuslinguistische Zugänge 
 überhaupt auch erst Verfestigungen in den Blick\, die als solche mit ande
 ren Methoden weitgehend unbemerkt bleiben.\n\nAuf der ALP-Tagung sollen th
 eoretische und empirische Zugriffe auf Verfestigungen und Verfestigtes auf
  allen Ebenen des Sprachgebrauchs diskutiert werden. Besonders erwünscht 
 sind Beiträge\, die theoretische Aspekte des Themas anhand von konkreten 
 empirischen Fallstudien behandeln. Mögliche Fragestellungen können sein:
 \n\n- Welche Rolle spielen sprachliche Verfestigungen auf den verschiedene
 n Ebenen des Sprachgebrauchs\, angefangen von grammatischen Mustern über 
 rekurrente Handlungstypen und Praktiken bis hin zu kommunikativen Gattunge
 n?\n- Welche pragmatischen Faktoren sind bei der Analyse sprachlicher Verf
 estigungen zu\nberücksichtigen?\n- Wie ist die pragmatische Funktionalit
 ät von sprachlichen Verfestigungen aus der Sicht der Sprachproduktion\, w
 ie aus der Sicht der Sprachrezeption zu erfassen?\n- Wie sind in linguisti
 schen Beschreibungen von Wortverbindungen (in Grammatiken\, in Lexika usw.
 ) pragmatische Aspekte zu berücksichtigen?\n- Welche Anschlussstellen erg
 eben sich zwischen der pragmatisch orientierten Phraseologie einerseits un
 d neueren Forschungsrichtungen wie der Interaktionalen Linguistik oder kon
 struktionsgrammatischen Ansätzen andererseits?\n- Welche Methoden sind ge
 eignet\, um in empirischen Analysen pragmatische Aspekte von sprachlichen 
 Verfestigungen und sprachlich Verfestigtem adäquat zu erfassen?\n\nKeynot

 nTranslation theory began primarily with the issue of the so-called lingui

 cerned pragmatic equivalence for example in domains such as courtroom inte
 rpreting and the translation of dialects and other forms of linguistic var
 iation.  Revisiting equivalence particularly with regard to pragmatics req
 uires investigations in all areas of pragmatics. In this session\, we wish
  to investigate how translators and communities interact in the creation o
 f pragmatic equivalence\, or lack thereof\, in translations.  We will conv
 ene a themed session on community aspects of translating pragmatics.

DESCRIPTION:AG 9: Geschriebene und gesprochene Sprache als Modalitäten ei
 nes Sprachsystems\n\nDie traditionelle Annahme\, dass die Schriftsprache d
 irekt von der gesprochenen Sprache abgeleitet ist\, hat sich in jüngerer 
 Forschung als problematisch erwiesen (vgl. für einen Überblick Dürschei
 d 2012). Primus (2003) spricht sich gegen eine direkte Ableitung aus und p
 ostuliert ein Schnittstellenmodell\, in dem gesprochene und geschriebene S
 prache Modalitäten eines übergreifenden Sprachsystems sind. Die geschrie
 bene Sprache korrespondiert in diesem Modell mit Subsystemen der Sprache (
 Phonologie\, Morphologie\, Syntax\, etc.) und bildet mit der gesprochenen 
 Sprache Schnittstellen.\n\nIn der Literatur ist bereits eine modalitätsü
 bergreifende Phonologie im Begriff\, sich zu etablieren (vgl. Domahs & Pri
 mus 2015). In dieser AG soll untersucht werden\, welche neuen Einblicke in
  Gemeinsamkeiten und Unterschiede zwischen Laut- und Schriftsprache ein so
 lcher modalitätsübergreifender Ansatz gewährt und inwiefern dieser Ansa
 tz darüber hinaus auch für andere Teilgebiete der Linguistik fruchtbar i
 st.\n\nWritten and spoken language as modalities of one paramount language
  system\n\nThe traditional view that written language directly derives fro
 m spoken language has been challenged in recent research (cf. Dürscheid 2
 012 for an overview). Primus (2003) argues against a direct derivation and
  postulates an interface-model in which spoken and written language are mo
 dalities of one paramount language system. In this model\, written languag
 e corresponds to subsystems of language (e.g. phonology\, morphology\, syn
 tax\, etc.) and forms interfaces with spoken language.\n\nCurrently\, a cr
 oss-modal phonology emerges in the literature (cf. Domahs & Primus 2015). 
 In this workshop\, we would like to investigate how an approach like the c
 ross-modal phonology may grant new insights into similarities and differen
 ces between spoken and written language and how cross-modal approaches can
  be adopted for other fields of linguistics.\n\nReferences:\n\nDomahs\, Ul

DESCRIPTION:This is the first international conference organised by the ne
 wly established AILA Research Network (ReN) on “Social and Affective Fac
 tors in Home Language Maintenance and Development”. The ReN was designed
  to have a broad scope which includes both formal (within school systems) 
 and informal (community-based grass-roots) initiatives with the aim of res
 earching and promoting home language maintenance and development. \n\nThe 
 conference aims at:\n\n- sharing and integrating knowledge gained from for
 mal and informal initiatives in the topic area of the ReN\n- identifying c
 hallenges for home language maintenance in diverse multilingual contexts\n
 - developing strategies to promote bi/multilingualism\n- fostering collabo
 rations both for research and outreach initiatives\n \nConference themes i
 nclude:\n\n- factors that affect language maintenance and development – 
 ranging from micro-level (family language policies and practices) to macro
 -level (mainstream educational policies and their implementation)\n- disse
 mination – approaches to information sharing between researchers and com
 munities\n- strategies to support and motivate families and communities to
  maintain their language and these strategies’ effectiveness\n- raising 
 awareness of bi/multilingualism in mainstream societies – is bi/multilin
 gualism seen as a threat or opportunity?\n\nAudience:\n\nThe conference is
  targeting scholars and PhD students involved in research and/or outreach 
 activities in the field of social and affective factors in home language m
 aintenance and development. The organisers aim to provide a meaningful for
 um for debate and collaboration between researchers. The event will be an 
 opportunity to consolidate and disseminate the activities of ReN members a
 s well as attract further interest from the research community and other i
 nterested parties.\n\nKeynote Speakers:\n\nWe are delighted that the follo

DESCRIPTION:Intercultural Competence: Traditions and Transitions\n\nFifth 
 International Conference on the Development and Assessment of Intercultura
 l Competence\n\nKeynote Speaker:\n\nFred Dervin (University of Helsinki\, 
 Finland)  \n \nPlenary Speakers:\n\nDwight Atkinson (University of Arizona
 \, USA)\nPaige Ware (Southern Methodist University\, USA)\n\nWriting in 19
 97\, Michael Byram describes intercultural communication as something that
  is historically continuous\, albeit not constant\, and as something that 
 shifted importantly at the turn of the last century. In a world that is in
 creasingly interconnected—virtually through digital technologies as well
  as physically through global migrations—communicating across cultures a
 nd languages is an inevitability for many people. And yet\, large-scale tr
 avel and tourism are hardly new to the Twenty-First Century and the extent
  to which intercultural communication is a qualitatively new human phenome
 non bears examination. At the same time\, intercultural competence\, as a 
 theorizable\, teachable\, and assessable skill or set of skills\, has been
  developed by scholars and practitioners in a variety of fields over the p
 ast few decades and now carries its own conceptual traditions—as reflect
 ed in the presentations over the past four conferences on the Development 
 and Assessment of Intercultural Competence in Tucson\, Arizona.\n\nStraddl
 ing tradition and transition\, this Fifth International Conference organiz
 ed by the Center for Educational Resources in Culture\, Language and Liter
 acy (CERCLL) will take stock of the histories that this field carries with
  it as well as the future directions it might take. This four-day event br
 ings together scholars and educators in order to foster a conversation abo
 ut what intercultural competence might mean to scholars and educators now\
 , and what theoretical models\, best practices\, and approaches are best s
 uited to fostering this sensibility in various learners.

DESCRIPTION:A universal property of natural language is that every languag
 e is able to express negation. Every language has some device at its dispo
 sal to reverse the truth-value of affirmative sentences. However\, languag
 es may differ to quite a large extent as to how they express this negation
 . Not only do languages vary with respect to the position of negative elem
 ents\, the form of negative elements and the interpretation of sentences t
 hat consist of multiple negative elements are also subject to broad cross-
 linguistic variation. The study of the behaviour of sentential negation ha
 s therefore strongly been guided by the question as to what determines the
  possible ways that sentential negation can manifest itself. This question
 \, however\, has not only strong repercussions for the study to the syntax
  and semantics of negation and related phenomena\, such as negative and po
 sitive polarity phenomena\, but also for the investigation of the way how 
 negation is expressed is acquired by children\, how it changes over time\,
  and how it is expressed on non-spoken languages.   In order to addr
 ess all these questions\, LinG - Linguistics in Göttingen hosts a 2-day i
 nternational workshop on negation in natural language. This workshop will 
 follow up on a four-day summer school for postdocs and PhD students workin
 g on or interested in negation. There will be fine invited speakers\, a po
 ster session and a number of slots reserved of talks based on submitted ab
 stracts.\n\n     Invited speakers:\n\n- Stephen Crain (Melbourne

DESCRIPTION:The teaching of English for Tourism (EfT) is one of the oldest
  and largest branches of English for Specific Purposes (ESP)\, responding 
 to the rise of middle class tourism during the 20th \nCentury and servicin
 g one of the fastest growing economic sectors in the world. Many universit
 ies\, high schools and private language schools have developed ESP courses
  for students\, \nworkers and managers in the field of tourism\; most majo
 r publishers of English Language Teaching resources have marketed course b
 ooks for Tourism Studies and various tourism \nprofessions\; and a growing
  body of research on the English of Tourism (EoT) has been disseminated vi
 a academic journals and major publishing houses. However\, there has been 
 \nrelatively little research and scholarship on the teaching of English fo
 r Tourism.\n\nThis gap in research and scholarship is in large part due to
  the nature of ESP in general. Most EfT research is conducted informally f
 or the purpose of developing custom courses and \nlearning material for a 
 specific group of students embedded in a unique learning context\, and\, t
 hough obviously relevant to practitioners in other contexts\, such researc
 h is rarely \npublished or shared with a wider professional or academic co
 mmunity. Especially in the West\, best practice in EfT remains the provinc
 e of individual teachers and small communities of \npractice largely worki
 ng independently of one another. In the absence of a discourse across inst
 itutions\, regions and nations\, teachers of EfT lack access to a wealth o
 f information and \nexperience that could inform their own teaching approa
 ches.\n\nThe symposium\, which would be one of the first of its kind in Eu
 rope\, aims to bring together teachers and researchers of English for Tour
 ism from diverse contexts in order to initiate a \nsustained academic disc
 ourse on the teaching of EfT.

DESCRIPTION:Terminology and Artificial Intelligence (TIA) 2015 will highli
 ght the close connection between multilingual terminology\, ontologies\, a
 nd the representation of specialized knowledge. Knowledge\, as regarded in
  Terminology\, is something more complex than a simple hierarchy or a thes
 aurus-like structure. In this sense\, ontologies\, understood as a shared 
 conceptualization of a domain that can be communicated between people and/
 or systems\, are better suited for accounting for multilinguality and cont
 extual constraints. The link between Terminology and knowledge representat
 ion has been widely acknowledged with the advent of multilingual ontologie
 s. \n \nThis is particularly relevant since today’s networked society ha
 s generated an increasing number of contexts where multilingualism challen
 ges current knowledge representation methods and techniques. To meet these
  challenges\, it is necessary to deal with semantics since information can
  be organized\, presented\, and searched\, based on meaning and not just t
 ext. Ideally\, this would mean that language-independent specialized knowl
 edge could be accessed across different natural languages. There is thus t
 he urgent need for high-quality multilingual knowledge resources that are 
 able to bridge communication barriers\, and which can be linked and shared
 .\n \nSuch issues can only be successfully addressed with creative collabo
 rative solutions within disciplines\, such as knowledge engineering\, term
 inology\, ontology engineering\, cognitive sciences\, corpus lexicology\, 
 and computational linguistics. Accordingly\, the TIA 2015 Conference will 
 provide a forum for interdisciplinary research that focuses on the interse
 ction of different disciplines dealing with terminology\, multilingualism\
 , lexicology\, ontology\, and knowledge representation.\n\nFeatured Plenar

DESCRIPTION:What do law and language have in common? To the untrained eye\
 , both may occasionally seem erratic or even chaotic\, as both can be desc
 ribed as ''phenomena of the third kind'': Not growing entirely rank\, but 
 not constructed to plan either - neither autonomous agents nor artificial 
 artifacts. Instead\, law and language are emergent: they emerge from theor
 y-based rules\, but not by way of arithmetic or logic - but by collective 
 habits giving rise to patterns of usage. Further considering that law can 
 only be conceived of through and in language\, it even forms a second-orde
 r usage pattern: law is one manifestation of how we use rules and norms st
 ated in language\, and is per se our way of using semantic symbols in gene
 ral. This understanding of law and language as an interwoven pattern-based
  fabric opens up exciting avenues for research: How does the practice of s
 peaking and writing in and about law shape our view of justice? What can w
 e learn from looking at large collections of legal texts through the lens 
 of corpus linguistics? How do patterns (pre-)determine law\, language and 
 law-through-language? And once we recognize such patterns: how much chaos 
 remains?\n\nThe conference addresses these and other questions through a s
 ystematic investigation of patterns in law and language\, particularly thr
 ough the lens of corpus linguistics as applied to textual mass data. It ai
 ms to bring together legal scholars\, linguists\, computational linguists\
 , media and communication analysts and policy makers\, but also welcomes i
 nterested members of other disciplines and faculties.\n\nKeynote speakers:
 \n\n- Lawrence Solan is Professor of Law and Director of Graduate Educatio
 n at Brooklyn Law School in New York (USA). Solan holds both a law degree 
 and a Ph.D. in linguistics. His scholarly works are largely devoted to exp
 loring interdisciplinary issues related to law\, language and psychology\,
  especially in the areas of statutory and contractual interpretation\, the
  attribution of liability and blame\, and linguistic evidence.\n\n- Tony M
 cEnery is Professor of English Language and Linguistics at the Lancaster U
 niversity (GB) and Director of the ESRC's Centre for Corpus Approaches to 
 Social Science. He has published several pioneering books and papers about
  the principles\, methods and applications of Corpus Linguistics.\n\nOrgan

DESCRIPTION:The power and politics of (re)naming plays a key role in the s
 ocial construction of space and in the complex process of attaching meanin
 g to places (Berg and Kearns 1996)\, in that names inscribe ideological me
 ssages about the past (and the present) into the texts of our everyday lif
 e\, thus making certain versions of history appear as the natural order of
  things (Azaryahy 1996). The cultural importance of place (re)naming as a 
 social negotiation process becomes even more crucial in colonial and post-
 colonial settings where\, like the naming of individuals and peoples\, it 
 often marks the ideological discourse enveloping the process of conquest a
 nd appropriation.\n\nWithin this shift towards a study of names that recog
 nizes the role of naming as an active and contestable process\, scholars i
 n the social sciences and humanities are investigating the power relations
  inherent in naming practices\, with a growing interest in the relationshi
 p between place names and discourses of national\, local\, and ethnic iden
 tity\, the commodification of place\, the cultural formation and administr
 ative shaping of space and the politics of collective memory through the c
 onstruction of commemorative landscapes (Azaryahu 1996\, Alderman 2009\, V
 uoltenaho and Berg 2009). Further lines of research have also addressed id
 entity related issues\, focusing on the ‘symbolic resistance’ of margi
 nalized voices (Alderman 2009) and on people reactions to being (re)named 
 as they are represented in blogs\, forums and online newspapers.\n\nRespon
 ding to this ‘critical turn’ in the field of toponymy\, the conference
  aims to foster interdisciplinary dialogue among scholars who work in diff
 erent geographical settings and historical contexts\, while also criticall
 y assessing theoretical traditions that have inspired contemporary place-n
 ame scholarship.\n\nKeynote speaker: Iman M. Nick\, University of Cologne\

DESCRIPTION:Probably the most widespread form of cultural and linguistic m
 ediation\, non-professional interpreting and translation has slowly begun 
 to receive the recognition it deserves within interpreting and translation
  studies. Pushing the boundaries of many definitions of translation and in
 terpreting\, it encompasses a dynamic\, under-researched field that is not
  necessarily subject to the norms and expectations that guide and constrai
 n the interpreting and translation profession. Even the designation ''non-
 professional'' is unclear\, referring at once to unpaid\, volunteer transl
 ation or interpreting and to translators and interpreters without specific
  training.\n\nNPIT3 provides a forum for researchers and practitioners to 
 discuss definitional\, theoretical\, methodological\, and ethical issues s
 urrounding the activities of non-professional interpreting and translation
 . Carrying forward the discussion initiated by the First International Con
 ference on Non-Professional Interpreting and Translation (NPIT1) at the Un
 iversity of Bologna/Forlì in 2012 and continued at Mainz University/Germe
 rsheim in 2014 (NPIT2)\, we invite proposals for panels\, presentations\, 
 or posters that deal with any theoretical\, empirical and methodological a
 spect of research related to the general theme of non-professional interpr
 eting and translation.

 e working languages in France across many professional settings. This conf
 erence seeks to provide insights into this phenomenon from angles such as 
 discourse analysis\, the ethnography of communication\, corpus analysis\, 
 or ICT studies. The conference will cover theoretical as well as practical
  or pedagogical issues stemming from this growing field study. Some exampl
 es of issues might be (and are not limited to) the notion of competence an
 d/or proficiency\, the relationships between specialized discourse and pro
 fessional discourse\, needs analysis\, and course design in English for pr
 ofessional/occupational purposes.

DESCRIPTION:Portuguese involvement in the description of South Asian langu
 ages dates back to the late 15th century\, when a short Malayalam vocabula
 ry was appended to the logbook of Vasco da Gama’s first voyage to India.
  The ensuing production of grammars\, dictionaries and translations turned
  Lisbon into one of the first European centres for the diffusion of lingui
 stic knowledge about South Asia and\, as a result\, some of the earliest g
 rammars of South Asian languages (such as Tamil\, Konkani\, Sinhala\, or B
 angla) produced by Europeans are nowadays preserved in Portuguese librarie
 s and archives. \n\nIn view of this tradition\, the Centre for Linguistics
  of the University of Lisbon is happy to host the 32nd edition of the Sout
 h Asian Languages Analysis Roundtable (SALA-32) between April 27 and 29\, 
 2016.\n\nSALA began in 1978 at the University of Illinois\, Urbana-Champai
 gn\, and has since then become established as one of the principal fora fo
 r the scholarly discussion of South Asian linguistics. Traditionally\, SAL
 A has been receptive to any descriptive\, theoretical\, or applied linguis
 tic research concerning the languages of South Asia\; the 32nd edition is 
 expected to be equally broad-ranging in terms of the topics and languages 
 represented.\n\nPlenary speakers (confirmed so far):\n\n- Anju Saxena (Upp

SUMMARY:Conference of the Swiss Association for Applied Linguistics (Vals-

DESCRIPTION:Conference of the Swiss Association for Applied Linguistics (V
 als-Asla): “The Process of differentiation: language practices in social
  interpretation”\n\nIf heterogeneity is inherent in the use of natural l
 anguages\, differences in language practices contribute to social differen
 tiation only when identified and interpreted (consciously or unconsciously
 ) through different filters. Thus\, based on the representations users in 
 social groups have\, certain language practices can become symbols\, while
  others will be processed or ignored. The social meaning of a linguistic p
 ractice\, however\, is not stably bound to a particular social group: its 
 inclusion in a network of equivalences and contrasts depends on the sociol
 inguistic configuration of a verbal interaction. As a result\, language pr
 actices can be redeployed in new configurations to signal new social bound
 aries. The speakers’ identifications\, however\, are not only determined
  by their own volition. The differentiation process involves\, in effect\,
  an interaction between external forces and the desire of a group to disti
 nguish themselves from others in a social space.\n\nThe aim of the confere
 nce is thereby to examine the role of language use in the construction of 
 boundaries (ethnic\, geographic\, etc.) in different social spheres (educa
 tion\, labor market\, political speech\, etc.). This conference will also 
 address the challenges of the differentiation process\, insofar as the ver
 y activity of creating borders – in its scope as inclusive and exclusive
  – involves the legitimacy of certain social affiliations.\n\nKeynote Sp

SUMMARY:Workshop: Sign Language Agreement Revisited: New Theoretical and E
 xperimental Perspectives

DESCRIPTION:Research in the last 30 years has shown that agreement in sign
  languages differs in interesting ways from agreement in spoken languages 
 (Lillo-Martin/Meier 2011\, Mathur/Rathmann 2012). In the literature\, vari
 ous phenomena such as verb agreement\, classifier constructions\, or role 
 shift have been subsumed under the notion of ‘agreement’. It has been 
 shown that agreement in sign language is subject to grammatical restrictio
 ns. At the same time\, its gestural basis and typological uniformity have 
 questioned the grammatical status of agreement in sign language. In each s
 ign language\, we find\, for instance\, similar distinctions between plain
  verbs\, i.e. verbs that are lexically specified as non-inflectional\, and
  agreement verbs\, i.e. verbs that show inflection. Likewise\, the system 
 of classifiers seems to be very similar across sign languages. Moreover\, 
 agreement may systematically incorporate gestural components.\n\nRecent em
 pirical studies and theoretical discussions initiated a controversial deba
 te about the grammatical status of agreement in sign languages and modalit
 y-specific properties such as the use of space\, body as subject\, incorpo
 ration of gestural components and the optionality of overt agreement marki
 ng (cf. e.g. Lillo-Martin/Meier 2011 and the comments on this paper\, de B
 euzeville et al. 2009\, Hänel-Faulhaber et al. 2014). Likewise\, studies 
 on the origin of agreement show that at least three (possibly modality-spe
 cific) aspects are relevant for a better understanding of agreement in sig
 n languages: (i) Sign languages seem to have the unique property to gramma
 ticalize gestural elements. (ii) Plain verbs may develop into agreement ve
 rbs over time. (iii) Some sign languages have systematically developed spe
 cific agreement markers to fill the agreement gap with plain verbs (Pfau/S
 teinbach 2011).\n\nThis workshop aims at expanding our understanding on ag
 reement in sign languages in particular and natural languages in general t
 hrough different typological\, experimental\, corpus-based\, and theoretic
 al approaches and addresses both well-established researchers and young re
 searchers. Submissions on but not limited to the following topics are invi
 ted:\n\n- Lexical\, morphological\, syntactic\, and semantic properties of
  various kinds of agreement in sign languages\n- Typological variation of 
 agreement (including standardized (‘old’) as well as young sign langua
 ges and ‘village sign languages’) \n- Modality-specific and modality-i
 ndependent typological aspects\n- The formal analysis of different phenome
 na related to sign language agreement such as\, for instance\, verb-argume
 nt agreement or classifier agreement) \n- Grammatical and semantic restric
 tions of agreement (such as\, for instance\, specific phonological restric
 tions\, animacy restriction\, verb type\, optionality) \n- Grammaticalizat
 ion of agreement at the interface between gesture and sign language\n- New
  insights from experimental and acquisitional studies on sign language agr
 eement \n- Corpus-based analyses of agreement phenomena in sign languages\
 n- Agreement verbs\, classifiers\, and role shift in complex sentence cons
 tructions and discourse\n\nThe languages of the workshop are English and A
 SL/IS. Interpretation between English and ASL/IS will be provided.

 meagwali (Central Connecticut State University)\nLisa Lim (University of H

 ce brings together scholars of different backgrounds to explore how knowle
 dge systems\, cultures\, languages\, and literary traditions have been aff
 ected by colonial and postcolonial conditions that are increasingly marked
  by contradictions\, cultural heterogeneity\, and transcultural processes.
  We are interested in the ways that colonial and postcolonial constellatio
 ns have been reflected\, shaped\, and negotiated by communication\, symbol
 ic practice\, and knowledge practices.\n\nWe will look critically at ongoi
 ng knowledge production and Eurocentric ‘intellectual dominance’ (Emea
 gwali 2003) in knowledge centers and discourses around the world. We aim t
 o crystallize decolonial strategies to challenge neocolonial tendencies in
  institutions of knowledge production and to probe the possibilities of in
 tegrating postcolonial knowledges into present knowledge discourses. Many 
 collaborations and attempts to interlink Eurocentric and non-Eurocentric k
 nowledge systems are already taking place\, and scholars around the globe 
 are producing alternative postcolonial visions of the world that are embed
 ded in non-European lives\, ontologies\, and philosophies (e.g. Armstrong 
 2009\; Atleo 2009\, 2011\; Dogbe 2006\; Garcés V 2012\; Moctar Ba 2013).\
 n\nTo address these issues\, the conference focuses on themes related to t
 he marginalization and displacement of local knowledge systems and the end
 angerment of languages as well as on epistemological and language ideologi
 es in colonial and postcolonial settings.

 junction with Conference on Digital Culture 2015: ''Animation Techniques a
 nd the Digital Art''.\n \nDigital Humanities used to be called ‘Humaniti
 es Computing’\, which largely refers to the mere application of computer
  technology in the humanities. Yet\, as the range of devices\, media and w
 eb technology proliferates in recent decades\, the digital experience has 
 come to play a central role in modern life. For many\, life in the digital
  era is meditated through the new media\, social networks\, and virtual ap
 plications. The digital experience is not just a part of everyday life\; i
 t has become everyday life. Critics and scholars in disciplines ranging as
  widely as art\, history\, film\, language\, literature\, education\, medi
 a studies\, and sociology now describe this emerging global phenomenon as 
 Digital Humanities\, an emerging field that increasingly grows in depth\, 
 diversity and richness. With the theme of ‘Digitization of the Humanitie
 s: Technologizing Interconnections in Art\, History and Literature’\, Co
 nference in Digital Humanities 2015 offers opportunities to explore key th
 emes\, impacts\, potentials and challenges in the digitization of the Huma

SUMMARY:Italian ‘Pluriverso’: Linguistic-Cultural Crossroads and Migra

DTSTART;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20151210T000000

DESCRIPTION:The coexistence of languages\, cultures\, traditions and knowl
 edge characterizes modern societies\, called to confront the phenomenon of
  migration\, diversity and otherness on a large scale that questions estab
 lished attitudes. Recent migratory flows from and to Italy\, create comple
 x problems on social\, cultural and linguistic levels impacting daily life
  and its educational contexts\, and in the process often alienates individ
 uals and collective identities.\n\nIn Italy\, like in many other countries
 \, national languages are increasingly becoming the vehicle of citizenship
  and of the (re)construction of identities of new citizens\, based on a mu
 ltiple identity that is in constant transformation.\n\nBesides language ed
 ucation\, these issues are reflected in social\, cultural and literary are
 as\, where a new complexity arises. The activity of migrant writers and au
 thors is emblematic as they move to Italy. Coming from different places or
  leaving the country to move abroad\, they write in Italian\, renewing as 
 they adapt to the cultural\, linguistic and literary heritage within and a
 cross national borders.\n\nThrough migratory flows and the linguistic-cult
 ural contact arising from them\, we can experience the outline of new adap
 table spaces\, fertile ground for the definition of new identities\, in an
 d through the Italian language and culture.\n\nIn this context\, the confe
 rence aims to become a place for international dialogue among scholars of\
 ndifferent disciplines\, whose work is often related in topics concerning 
 the connection between language-culture\, identity and migration patterns 
 in the Italian language\, according to a dual perspective that takes Italy
  as viewpoint:\n\n- A local component\, concerning migration to Italy\;\n-
  A global component\, on the migration of Italians abroad.\n\nInvited Spea

SUMMARY:New Ways of Analyzing Syntactic Variation 2

DTEND;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20160520T000000

DESCRIPTION:The GLIMS and EQTIS research units at Ghent University will ho
 st a two-day international symposium on new advances in research on syntac
 tic variation on 19-20 May 2016. The event is a follow-up to the first 'Ne
 w Ways of Analyzing Syntactic Variation' symposium that took place at the 
 Radboud University Nijmegen in November 2012. Its overall purpose is to st
 imulate discussion and interaction between researchers bringing new theore
 tical and/or methodological expertise to the linguistic study of syntactic
  variation\, broadly construed.\n\nSyntactic variation is a multidimension
 al concept: it can refer to the existence (in a single language variety) o
 f several syntactic patterns or constructions ''competing'' for the same f
 unctional space (i.e\, to grammatical alternations)\, or to any kind of so
 ciolinguistic or ''lectal'' variation in the formal and/or functional prop
 erties of syntactic patterns\, along regional\, social\, diachronic\, styl
 istic\, ethnic\, gender\, etc. dimensions (i.e.\, to syntactic patterns or
  constructions as sociolinguistic variables)\, or to a combination of both
 .\n\nSyntactic variation is a major area of research in different schools 
 of linguistics - including\, but not limited to\, construction grammar and
  related usage-based approaches\, generative grammar\, variationist sociol
 inguistics (cf. the advent of socio-syntax)\, psycholinguistics\, language
  acquisition research\, and computational linguistics/NLP  - and has accor
 dingly been approached from quite divergent theoretical and methodological
  perspectives. A common trend in all of these approaches is the increasing
  use of advanced methods and tools for the compilation and analysis of emp
 irical data. In addition\, there is a growing consensus that linguistic ar
 gumentation demands converging evidence based on an interdisciplinary appr
 oach and a growing body of work hence combines multiple empirical approach
 es to tackle one and the same linguistic phenomenon (e.g. combining advanc
 ed corpus analyses with survey and psycholinguistic experimental designs).
  \n\nNWASV2 offers a forum for original work on syntactic variation\, in a
 ny language or (present or historical) language variety - or varieties\, f
 or that matter - and from any theoretical perspective\, in which an awaren
 ess of recent theoretical insights and advances is paired with a concern f
 or appropriate empirical validation\, methodological innovation and interd
 isciplinarity. \n\nKeynote Speakers:\n\nArtemis Alexiadou (Humboldt Univer
 sity Berlin)\nHendrik De Smet (University of Leuven)\nStefan Th. Gries (Un

DESCRIPTION:EMNLP 2015 Workshop on Cognitive Aspects of Computational Lang
 uage Learning (CogACLL)\nSeptember 18\, 2015\nLisbon\, Portugal\n\nhttp//s
 ites.google.com/site/cognitivews2015\n\nThe human ability to acquire and p
 rocess language has long attracted interest and generated much debate due 
 to the apparent ease with which such a complex and dynamic system is learn
 t and used on the face of ambiguity\, noise and uncertainty. This subject 
 raises many questions ranging from the nature vs. nurture debate of how mu
 ch needs to be innate and how much needs to be learned for acquisition to 
 be successful\, to the mechanisms involved in this process (general vs spe
 cific) and their representations in the human brain. There are also develo
 pmental issues related to the different stages consistently found during a
 cquisition (e.g. one word vs. two words) and possible organizations of thi
 s knowledge. These have been discussed in the context of first and second 
 language acquisition and bilingualism\, with crosslinguistic studies shedd
 ing light on the influence of the language and the environment.\n \nThe us
 e of computational modeling is a relatively recent trend boosted by advanc
 es in machine learning techniques\, and the availability of resources like
  corpora of child and child-directed sentences\, and data from psycholingu
 istic tasks by normal and pathological groups. Many of the existing comput
 ational models attempt to study language tasks under cognitively plausible
  criteria (such as memory and processing limitations that humans face)\, a
 nd to explain the developmental stages observed in the acquisition and evo
 lution of the language abilities. In doing so\, computational modeling pro
 vides insight into the plausible mechanisms involved in human language pro
 cesses\, and inspires the development of better language models and techni
 ques. These investigations are very important since if computational techn
 iques can be used to improve our understanding of human language acquisiti
 on and change\, these will not only benefit cognitive sciences in general 
 but will reflect back to NLP and place us in a better position to develop 
 useful language models.\n \nSuccess in this type of research requires clos
 e collaboration between the NLP\, linguistics\, psychology and cognitive s
 cience communities. The workshop is targeted at anyone interested in the r
 elevance of computational techniques for understanding first\, second and 
 bilingual language acquisition and language change in normal and clinical 
 conditions. \n\nWorkshop Organizers and Contact:\n\nRobert Berwick\, Massa

DESCRIPTION:Prolonged exposure to high levels of ambient noise can lead to
  serious health effects\, decreases in comfort during communication\, and 
 cognitive impairment. Two important aspects of the disturbance caused by n
 oise on speech are its effects on speech intelligibility and vocal effort\
 , and therefore speaker comfort. In noisy environments\, speech prosodic c
 hanges can include a modification of fundamental frequency (F0) and a slow
 ing of speech rate and other durational modifications. These changes appea
 r to be made by the speaker to improve intelligibility for the listener. T
 his special session invites submissions addressing the impact of noise on 
 communication and speaker comfort. The topics will include\, but will not 
 be limited to\, the effects of noise\, speech style and room acoustic char
 acteristics on speech parameters\, talker intelligibility\, and self-repor
 ted speaker comfort. A discussion of the implications of noise exposure fo
 r occupational voice users and pupils in the classroom is encouraged. The 
 session will also provide a forum for discussing recent developments in th
 e study of vocal effort\, acoustic clarity\, and communication enhancement

DESCRIPTION:The 2nd International Conference on African Urban Youth Langua
 ges: Translingual Practices\, Gestures\, Media\, Style\n\nNairobi 11-13 De
 cember 2015\nHosted by Kenyatta University\n\nAfrican cities in the 21st c
 entury are host to rapidly changing linguistic practices\, with complex ca
 uses and effects of variation. Urban and Youth Languages have emerged in A
 frican cities to join the global repertoire of language resources and prac
 tices. The linguistic development\, changing status\, geographical and soc
 ial diversification of these non-standard varieties are of interest to a b
 road range of researchers studying social and linguistic change. An inaugu
 ral conference on African Urban and Youth Languages was held in Cape Town 
 on the 5th & 6th July 2013.  Following the success of that conference\, a 
 second was proposed for 2015\, to bring together scholars from around the 
 world in one of the locations where these youth languages is prevalent –
  Nairobi\, Kenya. The main objective is to provide a forum where this fiel
 d of study can be further developed and theorized.\n\nAfrican Urban and Yo
 uth Language can be framed within the concept of translingual practice\, w
 herein speakers draw on a range of multimodal resources including gestures
 \, styles or registers\, as well as a range of languages\, to make meaning
  in complex linguistic contexts.\n\nKeynote speakers: To be announced\n\nC

DESCRIPTION:“Fillmore's influential Santa Cruz Lectures on Deixis\, deli
 vered in 1971 (and published in 1975) were a major stimulant to the then n
 ascent field of linguistic pragmatics (concerned with the interaction betw
 een linguistic form and the context of utterance)\, which now flourishes
 ” (Paul Kay\, February 2014).\n\nLike much of Fillmore's work in general
 \, the papers on deixis foreshadowed concepts and constructs in linguistic
 s well before most other linguists had thought about them. While the deixi
 s work proved to be particularly important to the newly developing subfiel
 d of linguistic pragmatics\, all of Fillmore's work remains crucial to pra
 gmatics. The work on Case Grammar (Fillmore 1968) holds the seeds of the f
 rame idea\, which eventually blossomed into Frame Semantics (e.g. Fillmore
  1975\, 1985.)\, whose principles constitute the theoretical basis of Fram
 eNet (framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu). A research project in corpus-based comp
 utational lexicography\, FrameNet embodies Fillmore's work in lexical sema
 ntics\, the syntax-semantics interface\, and grammar. Fillmore's descripti
 on and analysis of lexical items would necessarily include the presupposit
 ions that the lexical item carries (e.g. Fillmore 1971). And\, the FrameNe
 t Constructicon (Fillmore et al. 2012) developed initially as a companion 
 to the FrameNet lexicon\, instantiates the principles of Construction Gram
 mar (e.g. Fillmore 1986\, 1988).\n\nHonoring the contributions of Charles 
 J. Fillmore to pragmatics broadly conceived\, this panel will include pres
 entations from those working in various areas of linguistics that Fillmore
 's path-breaking work has shaped.

DESCRIPTION:The Diachrony of Satellite or Verb-framed languages\nUlster Un
 iversity\, Belfast\, 16 October 2015\nKeynote speakers: Elena Anagnostopou
 lou\, Jaume Mateu\, Victor Acedo- Matellan\, Michelle Troberg\nConference 
 organizers: Athanasia Asyllogistou\, Raffaella Folli\, Christina Sevdali\n
 \nThe distinction between satellite-framed vs verb-framed languages has su
 stained a long and privileged position in theoretical literature. Since Ta
 lmy (1975)’s seminal work where it is argued that languages vary on thei
 r availability to express both motion and manner in the verbal component\,
  there has been extensive discussion on the cross-linguistic variation of 
 how this notion of complementarity is expressed. Talmy (1985) correlated t
 he availability of the manner-of-motion structure with the availability of
  other patterns\, including adjectival resultatives and verb-particle cons
 tructions. Following Talmy’s proposal in the literature we find varied a
 nd often controversial accounts of the observed cross-linguistic variation
  (see for example Folli (2002) and Folli and Harley (2005\, 2006\, 2008\, 
 2013) for English and Italian\, Acedo-Matellán  (2006\, 2010) for Latin \
 , and more generally Romance languages\, Nikitina (2013) for Ancient Greek
 \, Papafragou et al. (2006) for Modern Greek\, Iacobini & Massini (2007) f
 or Italian\,  Kopecka (2009) for French\, Inagaki (2002) for Japanese\, am
 ong others). See also Beavers\, Levin\, and Tham 2011 for a recent summary
  and synthesis. Recent work by Folli and Harley (2012) have proposed a mor
 e syntactic approach to the distinction\, showing that a head movement par
 ameter\, a Res-to-v parameter is responsible for the distinction as well a
 s the host of properties associated with being verb-framed vs satellite-fr
 amed.\n\nRecent work on languages such as Latin (Acedo-Matellan 2010)\, Ol
 d French (Troberg and Burnett\, 2011)\, and Modern Greek (Alexiadou and An
 agnostopoulou\, 2014) reveal that the diachrony can shed further light on 
 the parametric conditions of languages that do not strictly adhere to Talm
 y’s (1975\, 1985\, 2000) typological distinctions.\n\nThis workshop aims
  at discussing exactly this: how the diachrony of languages that exhibit (
 or not) a typological shift from satellite to verb framedness and vice ver
 sa can help us understand both the nature of the parameter(s) involved and
  the nature and processes of change.

DESCRIPTION:This conference\, the ninth in a series dedicated to issues in
  the syntax and semantics of the noun phrase\, brings together a working g
 roup of Canadian and international linguists who specialize on the noun ph
 rase. We are interested in the many ways in which natural languages catego
 rize nouns into genders or classes. A noun may belong to a given class bec
 ause of its logical or symbolic similarities with other nouns\, because it
  shares a similar morphological form with other nouns\, or simply through 
 an arbitrary convention. We try to determine what is responsible for this 
 type of classification\, paying special attention to the functional and le
 xical categories that make up the syntactic spine. This topic is a natural
  continuation in the Canadian series on nouns\, which has considered vario
 us other aspects of structure internal to noun phrases (e.g. relative clau
 ses\, modifiers\, determiners). This conference focuses specifically on ho
 w gender can sometimes function as a classifying device and how\, in the a
 bsence of gender as a classifying device\, determiners and other functiona
 l elements in the nominal spine come to fill that gap. The papers in this 
 conference could focus on empirical questions such as these but many other
  questions will arise:\n\nI. What is the relationship between gender\, num
 ber and classification?\nII. What is the role of the plural (some language
 s have many plurals\, e.g. Arabic)?\nIII. What is the role of the determin
 er in the noun phrase? Is it obligatory\, is it related to phasehood\, and
  if so\, how?\n\nRegistration details can be found here: http://artsites.u

DESCRIPTION:For this two-day research workshop we wish to gather a variety
  of perspectives on the – individual\, institutional\, or political – 
 management of linguistic diversity in different institutional settings.\n\
 n‘Linguistic diversity’ is a concept around which many research projec
 ts are organized in linguistic\, anthropological\, cultural\, educational 
 and other studies. The aim of our workshop is to initiate discussion betwe
 en scholars researching ‘linguistic diversity’ in various institutiona
 l surroundings and to reflect on its conditions\, consequences and challen
 ges in ongoing research projects.\n\n‘Institutional settings’ may\, on
  the one hand\, refer to particular institutions\, such as a school or kin
 dergarten\, a company or a public authority. On the other hand\, in discou
 rse and language use\, various kinds of institutional settings affect inte
 ractions between participants. Participants enact institutional roles\, an
 d institutional settings define social hierarchies and other frames. Lingu
 istic diversity (on the individual level\, in society\, or as part of the 
 institutional frames) is managed and contextualized in various ways\, in i
 nteraction\, through language ideologies\, active language management\, or
  multimodal frames in linguistic landscapes.\n\nBeyond individual presenta
 tions\, the workshop will provide space for discussions surrounding resear
 ch practices\, ideologies of ‘linguistic diversity’ in the field and i
 n research\, and the role of the researcher vis-à-vis institutional struc
 tures and vice versa.\n\nWe have invited three external guests from differ

DESCRIPTION:The Workshop 'Indefinites between Theory and Language Change' 
 is organized as part of the Annual Conference of the Deutsche Gesellschaft
  für Sprachwissenschaft (DGfS) ''Sprachkonzil: Theorie und Experiment'' t
 o be held at the University of Konstanz\, Germany February\, 24-26\, 2016.
 \n\nLanguage users employ indefinites\, pronouns ('someone'\, 'anything'\,
  'whatever') and different types of noun phrases ('a book'\, 'a certain st
 udent'\, 'some time'\, 'any teacher')\, to encode (non-)referentiality\, b
 ut also other crucial properties\, such as degree of identifiability\, spe
 aker-hearer knowledge status\, discourse saliency. Recent typological and 
 theoretical studies have uncovered a wealth of variation in this domain\, 
 on various grammatical levels (morpho-syntax\, semantics\, pragmatics). Th
 e emerging picture needs to be complemented by a comparative evaluation of
  the observed diachronic patterns. Research on the history of indefinite a
 rticles and some classes of indefinite pronouns in individual languages ha
 s advanced substantially. We face scenarios that challenge well-known mode
 ls of development and therefore need a broader cross-linguistic perspectiv
 e on evolutionary tendencies\, also encompassing non-Indo-European languag
 es. A more fine-grained study of the diachronic clines involving indefinit
 es may shed light on some of their intriguing synchronic properties (morph
 o-syntactic complexity\, multifunctionality\, context dependence)\, and on
  the way systems of indefinites are structured (complementarity\, blocking
 ). The investigation further promises to disclose more general conclusions
  on the systematic nature of change affecting functional elements of the l
 exicon. We therefore invite contributions from linguists of various persua
 sions\, reconciling in-depth theoretical analysis with comparative and dia
 chronic evidence.\n\nOrganizers:\n\nChiara Gianollo (University of Cologne

 une pensée comme « désappropriée » qu'il s'agit. En effet\, qu'on le 
 considère comme un « faux »\, comme une « vulgate »\, ou un « apocry
 phe »... le Cours de Linguistique Générale est le texte de référe
 nce pour la plupart des courants de la linguistique du XX° siècle. Acti
 vement (les structuralismes\, mais aussi G. Guillaume ou E. Benveniste) ou
  réactivement (le générativisme\, la sociolinguistique\, la linguist
 ique cognitive...)\, le Cours de Linguistique Générale constitue un re
 père majeur de l'histoire contemporaine des idées linguistiques (et au
 ssi des idées tout court...). Comment peut-on aujourd’hui évaluer la 
 présence / absence du Cours de linguistique générale dans l’horizon d
 e rétrospection des linguistiques les plus actuelles ?\n\nAu-delà du cas
  évident de la linguistique\, que doivent les Sciences humaines à la pub
 lication\, il y a un siècle du Cours de linguistique générale ? Peut-on
  aujourd’hui poser la question aussi directement ? La lecture structural
 iste du CLG a conduit à façonner un espace conceptuel désigné par « s
 tructuralisme » qui lui-même a désigné durant de nombreuses années un
 e sorte de fond commun auquel puisaient les Sciences humaines pour se déf
 inir et se développer. La phénoménologie avec Merleau-Ponty\, l’anthr
 opologie avec Lévi-Strauss\, la psychanalyse avec Lacan\, la sémiologie 
 avec Greimas\, par exemple\, ont profité de cet espace d’idées et ont 
 contribué\, peu à peu\, à l’idéologiser. Parallèlement\, ce mouveme
 nt étant issu d’une nouvelle compréhension de la linguistique\, c’es
 t le rapport même entre sciences humaines – dans leur ensemble et au ca
 s par cas – et sciences du langage qui a été modifié.\n\nSi l’inven
 tion progressive et multiforme du « structuralisme » a profité à la vi
 sibilité des sciences humaines dans les années 1960-1970\, quelle place 
 tient aujourd’hui dans leurs travaux théoriques le CLG ?

DESCRIPTION:The Department of Linguistics\, North-Eastern Hill University 
 (NEHU) is pleased to announce that it is organizing a two day Internationa
 l Conference on Syntactic Typology: Language Contact and Convergence.\n\nT
 he relationship between language contact and syntactic typology in Linguis
 tics has been\, till date\, an extensive area of research. The various asp
 ects of language change as results of language contacts are obvious. Howev
 er\, the distinctiveness of various strands of language contact in the ‘
 New Linguistics World Order’ and possible implications of different type
 s of language contact on syntactic typology have not yet been sufficiently
  recognized and explored. These issues will be brought into focus by ensur
 ing that even local languages are given a voice. Because of the pioneering
  nature of the theme of conference\, it is felt necessary not to impose a 
 preordained set of topics or issues for the participants. It is an attempt
  to kick-start such dialogue concerning the evolution of syntactic typolog
 y in the nest of language contact and convergence. The main objective of t
 he conference is to encourage the greatest possible degree of engagement a
 mong contributors of different streams of linguistics. It will also locate
  North-East languages within the broader trends of Pan-Indian Linguistics 
 and South Asian languages.\n\nThe following sub-themes will testify the in
 tellectual vibrancy of the conference:\n\n- Syntactic Typology\n- Language
  Typology\, Areal Typology and Syntactic Description\n- Morpho-Syntax\n- G
 enerative Syntax\n- Language Contact and Convergence\n- Structure of South
  Asian Languages\n- Language Construction and Discourse\n- Language Global
 ization and Language Structure\n- New writings and New Grammatical Structu
 res\n- Emerging Domains and Grammatical Analysis\n- Public Space and Struc
 tural Analysis\n\nThis International Conference will also include a 4 day 
 workshop\, with an objective to promote recent developments in training an
 d research techniques on language analysis to research scholars and studen
 ts across India who are working in research areas related to the theme of 
 the conference. In particular\, research scholars from the North-East regi
 on of India will be trained to work on the numerous languages\, regional v
 arieties and dialects of the region.\n\nVenue: North Eastern Hill Universi

DESCRIPTION:As with previous SAMWOP conferences\, this workshop is an atte
 mpt to bring together linguists working in Southern African microlinguisti
 cs (broadly defined as linguistics which focuses on the structure of langu
 age as opposed to\, for example\, its sociological or educational role in 
 society). This includes researchers based in Southern Africa working in va
 rious areas of linguistics\, as well as those based elsewhere working on S
 outhern African languages. The workshop provides an opportunity for in-dep
 th presentation and discussion\, with hour-long time slots available\, and
  no parallel sessions.\n\nAs with the previous SAMWOP workshops\, a specia
 l issue of Stellenbosch Papers in Linguistics Plus will be set aside to wh
 ich attendees will be encouraged to submit their papers.\n\nRhodes Univers
 ity will provide a venue for the talks\, but workshop attendees will have 
 to pay their own way in terms of accommodation and travel. There will be n
 o workshop registration fee.

DESCRIPTION:The University of the Western Cape is hosting a two and half d
 ay LL workshop focusing on dynamic research conducted from the South perta
 ining to inter alia: interplay between written and oral landscapes\, sound
 scapes\, the politics of multilingualism and corporeal sociolinguistics an
 d new methodologies and technologies. This workshop is important as it cha
 mpions epistemological theory and access regarding linguistic landscapes o
 f the South\, specifically focussing on the ‘South’ as a symbolic stru
 ggle for equality\, power\, voice and agency and not simply geographically
 -defined. In this regard\, research pertaining to marginalized communities
  and the diaspora globally will be of interest at this workshop. The aim o
 f the workshop\, therefore\, is to uncover latent\, absent\, silent\, oppr
 essed and mobile or corporeal items which construct the LL of the South.\n
 \nThe workshop invites original research from postgrads\, young and senior
  academics alike. As LL studies are largely interdisciplinary\, we look fo
 rward to papers from: semiotics\, literacy studies\, political science\, a
 rt\, geography and urban planning (to name a few).\n\nContributors are enc
 ouraged to submit original work which orients towards (but is not restrict
 ed to) the following themes:\n\n- Phenomenological approaches to LL\n- Ora
 l narrations of place\n- Messy multilingualism\n- Power and prejudice\n- M
 obile semiotic landscapes\n\nImportant Dates:\n\n- Submission of Abstracts
  Opens: 1 August 2015\n- Submission of Abstracts Closes: 15 October 2015\n
 - Notification of Acceptance: 1 November 2015\n- Registration Opens: 10 No

 ill accept:\n\n1) Individual papers: Individual papers are formal presenta
 tions on original research by one or more authors\, lasting a total of 30 
 minutes (20 minutes for presentation and 10 minutes for discussion). Pleas
 e note that the time limit will be strictly adhered to. The length of abst
 racts for individual papers is max 250 words.\n\n2) Posters: Poster sessio
 ns are for displaying research and offer the opportunity for individualize
 d further discussions in smaller groups. Posters are also a good format fo

DESCRIPTION:10th Mediterranean Morphology Meeting (MMM10)\n\nThe 10th Medi

 Haifa (Israel)\, September 7-10\, 2015.\n\nThe theme of the conference wil
 l be:\n\n“Quo vadis morphology? Grammar\, cognition and computation”\n
 \nMMM celebrates its 10th meeting with a look at the present and future of
  morphology. How has the field evolved in recent years?  Where do we stand
  now?  And\, most importantly\, Where do we go from here? We welcome contr
 ibutions that explore new empirical and methodological directions in morph
 ology\, especially in the following domains:\n\n- Morphology and Grammar: 
 What is (or should be) the place of morphology in linguistic theory? How d
 o we face well-known challenges to foundational issues such as the notion 
 of word\, the Lexical Integrity Hypothesis\, or the universality of lexica
 l/grammatical categories?\n- Morphology and Cognition: What can morphology
  tell us about the mind?  About language acquisition?  How can we reconcil
 e morphological theory and experimental research?  What can morphology lea
 rn from the other cognitive sciences?\n- Morphology and Computation: What 
 are the new frontiers for computational approaches to morphology? How is t
 he “big-data effect” affecting morphological research and morphologica
 l theory?\n\nThe aim of these meetings is to bring together linguists who 
 work on morphology in an informal setting which guarantees maximal interac
 tion between researchers\, and gives young linguists an opportunity to pre
 sent their work at a conference of moderate size where fruitful contacts w
 ith senior linguists can be established.  The traditional emphasis on morp
 hology of European languages is expanded in this 10th anniversary meeting 
 to also include local languages of Israel as well as sign languages\, and 
 will emphasize future directions in morphology\, such as morphology and co
 gnition\, and computational approaches.\n\nInvited Speakers:\n\nStephen R.
  Anderson (Yale University)\nMark Aronoff (Stony Brook University)\nRay Ja
 ckendoff (Tufts University)\n\nProgram Outline:\n\nSeptember 7: Morning: F

DESCRIPTION:The study of pronouns has been an engine behind the developmen
 t of many theories in grammar. Much has been learned about pronouns\, and 
 yet the topic continues to be an area of fruitful research. Lively debates
  on strong and weak pronouns\, free and bound variable pronouns\, de se an
 d de re pronouns\, indexical pronouns and fake indexicals\, indefinites\, 
 simplex and complex anaphors abound in the current linguistic literature. 
 \n\nQuestions related to the nature\, distribution\, interpretation\, acqu
 isition and processing of pronouns\, although not a novelty\, have not set
 tled throughout generative grammar enterprise\, as may be seen in the lite
 rature (Büring\, 2005\; Cardinaletti & Starke\, 1999\; Chomsky\, 1981\;

  pronoun behavior would be an ideal atmosphere to discuss those aspects ab
 out the architecture of grammar. The workshop aims at providing a forum fo

 to set up a workshop\, and everyone is welcome to attend. \n\nThe topic of
  the 2016 MFM FRINGE workshop is Computation and Learnability in Phonology
 .\n\nComputation and learnability continue to play an important role in ph
 onological theory with many recent developments moving along different lin
 es of research. The fringe workshop of the Manchester Phonology Meeting (t
 he 'MFM') in 2016 will therefore be devoted to computation and learnabilit

 den letzten Jahren von einem stief­mütterlich behandelten Seitentrieb de
 r Fachsprachengeschichte zu einem fruchtbaren For­schungs­­feld im Schn
 ittbereich literatur- und kulturwissenschaftlicher\, wissens-\, wissenscha
 fts- und universitätsgeschichtlicher\, nicht zuletzt natürlich auch spra
 chhistorischer Zugänge ent­wickelt. Allerdings ist eine Integration der 
 unterschiedlichen Forschungsansätze im Hinblick auf eine fächerübergrei
 fende Wissenschaftssprachgeschichte noch nicht gelungen. Zum Teil haben si
 ch selbst in nah verwandten Diskussions­zusam­menhängen eigentümliche 
 definitorische Unschärfen verfestigt\, da sich der Begriff ‚Wissen­sch
 aftssprache‘ auf ganz unterschiedliche Weise konzeptualisieren lässt\, 
 etwa über die institutionelle Verankerung (die spezifische Trägerschaft 
 institutionell vermittelter Bildung)\, den Gegenstandsbereich (die untersc
 hiedliche Wissenschaftswürdigkeit bestimmter Themenfelder und Disziplinen
 ) oder den Reflexionsmodus (die jeweilige Form der rationalen Anverwandlun
 g von Gegen­ständen).\n\nIst es vor diesem Hintergrund möglich und erst
 rebenswert\, sich auf ein gemeinsames und operationalisierbares Konzept vo
 n Wissenschaftssprache zu verständigen? Inwieweit erscheint es überhaupt
  statthaft\, für konkrete Zirkulationsformen frühneuzeitlichen Wissens i
 n der akademischen Domäne von historischer Wissenschaftskommunikation zu 
 sprechen? Die geplante Tagung soll einen Beitrag dazu leisten\,\n\n- die h
 istorischen Gelehrten- und Wissen­schafts­­sprachen als ein wichtiges i
 nterdisziplinäres Forschungsfeld historisch klarer zu kontu­rieren\,\n- 
 die bestehenden Forschungsansätze zusammenzuführen sowie über Fächer- 
 und Ländergrenzen hinaus besser anschlussfähig zu machen\,\n- Fragen der
  Sprachenwahl und des Sprachenwechsels bei der Betrachtung konkreter Zirku
 lationsformen von Wissen in historischen Gelehrten- und Wissenschafts­kul

SUMMARY:Compounding and Derivation: Interactions in Structure and Interpre
 tation

DESCRIPTION:Compounding and derivation are word-formation processes that b
 uild new lexemes. Beyond the usual language-specific and universal problem
 s of definition (see Lieber & Stekauer 2009\, 2014)\, what the two process
 es have in common (and what differentiates them from inflection) is their 
 combining content morphemes (e.g.\, roots\, stems\, affixes)\, whose inter
 action raises intricate questions about both the morphosyntax and the comp
 ositional interpretation of the output. Historically speaking\, affixes ma
 y develop from productive compound parts that no longer preserve their fre
 e form (e.g.\, -ship\, -hood\, -ful)\, and synchronic formations may exhib
 it properties in between derivation and compounding as a result of languag
 e change (e.g.\, manlike\, trustworthy\; see Marchand 1969\, Dalton-Puffer
  & Plag 2001\, Trips 2009\, Schlücker 2012\, Werner 2012\, and Olsen 2014
  for an overview). In addition\, the linguistic tradition has long debated
  the status of so-called synthetic compounds\, in which compounding and de
 rivation interact (e.g.\, dog-train-er\, long-leg(g)-ed)\, although for va
 rious theoretical reasons neither of the two naturally qualifies as preced
 ing the other (see\, e.g.\, Levi 1978\, Roeper & Siegel 1978\, Selkirk 198
 2\, Lieber 1983\, 2004\, Booij 1988\, 2005\, Leser 1990\, Ackema & Neelema
 n 2004\, Harley 2009\, Borer 2013).\n\nThe main difference between these t
 wo processes is morphological: derivation adds an affix to a lexeme (root 
 or stem\; e.g.\, play-er)\, while compounding puts together two lexemes (e
 .g.\, fair play). A direct consequence of this difference concerns the int
 erpretation: while affixes usually contribute a compositional (though\, po
 ssibly\, polysemous) meaning to derived words\, the semantic relations bet
 ween the parts of primary compounds\, in particular\, may be rather unders
 pecified (see the notorious German example Fischfrau 'fish woman'). But be
 yond these differences\, compounding and derivation have similar structura
 l properties (binary branching\, recursion\, and headedness\; Olsen 2014).

DESCRIPTION:The Bamberg Graduate School of Linguistics is organizing a sym
 posium on research methods in linguistics\, which will take place November
  27 - 28\, 2015 at the University of Bamberg\, Germany.\n\nMeeting Descrip
 tion:\n\nOver the past few decades\, linguistic theorizing has benefited f
 rom an increasing trend towards empirical methodologies across all discipl
 ines. Methodological know-how – both productive and receptive – has th
 us become one of the key qualifications for (beginning) researchers. The e
 mpirical turn in linguistics has gone hand in hand with a considerable div
 ersification of research methods. This diversity\, which has come to be se
 en as a strength of linguistics as a field\, has also benefited linguistic
  theory building. \n\nMaLT provides a forum for researchers to meet peers 
 from other branches of linguistics\, look beyond their specific disciplina
 ry boundaries and draw inspiration from neighboring fields. With its empha
 sis on cross-disciplinary exchange\, it offers researchers the opportunity
  to expand their repertoire of theoretical approaches and methods within a
 nd beyond those typically adopted in their subfield. The program will stri
 ke a balance between talks and workshops with a methodological focus\, whi
 ch offer hands-on practical advice on a diverse number of topics.\n\nInvit
 ed Speakers:\n\nMartin Hilpert\, Université de Neuchâtel\, Switzerland\n
 Alexander Ziem\, Universität Düsseldorf\, Germany\n\nWorkshops (2 x 90 m
 inutes):\n\n- Experimental methods in discourse processing\nFranziska Hart
 ung\, Max-Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics\, Nijmegen (Netherlands)\
 n\n- Introduction to statistics for corpus linguistics\nStefan Evert\, Fri
 edrich-Alexander Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (Germany)\n\n- How to col
 lect (and combine) linguistic and behavioural data - A practical workshop 
 on experiments in linguistics\nFranziska Günther\, Ludwig-Maximilians Uni
 versität München (Germany)\n\n- Corpus linguistics: a practical introduc
 tion to corpus methods and corpus tools\nSamantha Laporte\, Université ca
 tholique de Louvain (Belgium)\n\nThe conference is aimed at early-career r
 esearchers (graduate students\, PhD candidates and Postdocs) from all ling
 uistic disciplines and neighboring fields with an interest in empirical ap
 proaches to language studies. There is no conference fee\, but participant
 s need to register and sign up for workshops (for details\, please visit h

SUMMARY:Long-term Histories of Grammatical Traditions

DESCRIPTION:Expressions of interest are invited for a working group on the
  long-term histories of grammatical traditions\, and on the interactions b
 etween different grammatical traditions. The activities of the working gro
 up will include a workshop\; participation will be generously funded for u
 p to ten participants by the project's sponsor\, the UK's Arts and Humanit
 ies Research Council. Activities will also include preparing individual co
 ntributions for publication\, and contributing to a multi-authored article
 \; publication mentoring will be offered to early-career participants and 
 any others who would like such support.\n\nSubject Area:\n\nWhen a languag
 e changes\, concepts of grammatical description may remain the same in nam
 e while acquiring a different value. For example\, the distinctive contras
 t between long and short vowels found in Classical Greek was lost at some 
 point after the Classical period\, yet grammarians continued to operate wi
 th the concept that some vowels were 'long' and others 'short'\, and conti
 nued to put this concept to work in describing the language as a whole. St
 atements of possible positions for the word accent continued to invoke thi
 s distinction between 'long' and 'short' vowels: the accent fell on one of
  the last three syllables in the word\, and normally on one of the last tw
 o if the final syllable contained a 'long vowel'. For this purpose\, the t
 eaching of traditional vowel lengths survived into the school tradition on
  modern Greek until fairly recently. In effect\, what had once been an aud
 ible or surface distinction became an abstract or underlying feature—a t
 echnical device that helped in the description of complex patterns of alte
 rnation. \n\nTerms and concepts of grammatical description may also be bor
 rowed from the description of one language into that of another. But the g
 rammatical categories of one language may not map neatly onto those of ano
 ther. As a result\, features of one language may be imported into the desc
 ription of another\, but at an abstract level of the descriptive system. F
 or example\, Latin grammars influenced the early English grammatical tradi
 tion\, with results including the idea that English nouns and adjectives h
 ave all the grammatical genders and cases found in Latin. These features o
 f Latin could be imported on an abstract level as long as one recognised t
 hat grammatical gender never determines the form of an English noun or adj
 ective\, and most of the cases sound identical (see e.g. U. Dons\, Descrip
 tive Adequacy of early modern English grammars\, Mouton de Gruyter 2004\, 
 pp. 39–53\, 214–16\; H. Gwosdek\, Lily’s Grammar of Latin in English
 \, Oxford University Press 2013\, pp. 136–7).\n\nFruitful work has been 
 done\, and is currently being done\, on topics connected to the long-term 
 histories of grammatical traditions and their interactions with one anothe
 r. Much of this work is naturally embedded in scholarship on the individua
 l languages involved. But it is also worth taking a comparative perspectiv
 e: what common themes and problems emerge if scholars working on such topi
 cs talk to each other?\n\nFor further details\, please see the Call for Pa

DESCRIPTION:Whereas it is common knowledge that people differ considerably
  in their ability to learn new languages\, it is less obvious that people 
 also differ in how easily they process their native language\, in which th

 portantly\, these findings have hardly made their way into models of langu
 age processing.\n\nResearchers working on different language modalities (s
 peech perception\, production\, and reading) are invited to discuss the fo
 llowing topics: \n\n- How can individual differences research (or group di
 fferences research) inform models of spoken or written language processing
 ?\n- Do abilities that consistently predict comprehension ability also pre

DESCRIPTION:The widespread use of deception in offline and online communic
 ation suggests the need for methods to automatically detect deceit. The 20
 15 ACM Workshop on Multimodal Deception Detection (WMDD 2015)\, held in co
 njunction with the 17th ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interac
 tion (ICMI 2015)\, will focus on multimodal and interdisciplinary approach
 es to deception detection\, as well as approaches that utilize a single mo
 dality with clear potential for integration with additional modalities. De
 ception detection has received an increasing amount of attention due to th
 e significant growth of digital media\, as well as increased ethical and s
 ecurity concerns. Earlier approaches to deception detection were mainly fo
 cused on law enforcement applications and relied on polygraph tests\, whic
 h had proven to falsely accuse the innocent and free the guilty in multipl
 e cases. More recent work on deception has expanded to other applications\
 , such as deception detection in social media\, interviews\, or deception 
 in day-by-day interactions. Moreover\, recent research on deception detect
 ion has brought together scientists from fields as diverse as computationa
 l linguistics\, speech processing\, computer vision\, psychology\, and phy
 siology\, which makes this problem particularly appealing for multimodal p
 rocessing.\n\nThe ACM Workshop on Multimodal Deception Detection (WMDD 201
 5) encourages the submission of papers that address the multimodal perspec
 tive of deception detection\, as well as papers that use clues from a sing
 le modality but with the clear potential of being integrated with addition
 al modalities. We also encourage the submission of interdisciplinary work 
 stemming from a variety of fields such as computational linguistics\, spee
 ch processing\, computer vision\, psychology\, physiology\, and others.

SUMMARY:Adjective Order: Theory and Experiment

DESCRIPTION:In linguistics\, the issue of adjective order has a long histo
 ry. Bloomfield (1933) already made some remarks on the robust restriction 
 that size adjectives usually precede color adjectives (a small black dog v
 s. a black small dog). Following these early notes\, many researchers in l
 inguistic typology investigated adjective order in the form of semantic hi
 erarchies (Dixon 1982\, Bache and Davidsen-Nielsen 1997). Our workshop aim
 s at bringing together recent work from both theoretical and experimental 
 linguistics to reframe this classical topic.\n\nIn particular\, we are int
 erested in the tension between proposals of fine-grained syntactic hierarc
 hies (Scott 2002\; Laenzlinger 2005) and large-scale semantic distinctions
  as being relevant for ordering (Stavrou 2001\; Truswell 2009). Furthermor
 e\, do non-canonical orders involve a specialized focus position (cf. the 
 BLACK small dog (and not the BROWN small dog)\; e.g. Alexiadou et al. 2007
 \; Svenonius 2008)\, or do other semantic factors explain such patterns (C
 inque 2010\, 2014)? Experimental evidence has shown that the abstract prin
 ciples governing adjective order seem to constitute a separate domain of r
 epresentation that can be selectively impaired (Kemmerer et al. 2009). Exp
 erimental work can have important impact on theory in many respects. For e
 xample\, to what extent is the phenomenon syntactic at all\, given that (s
 ome) non-canonical orders do not result in syntactic processing difficulti
 es (Huang & Federmeier 2012)? Can the role of abstract semantic categories
  in linear precedence be reduced to mere online abstraction (Vandekerckhov
 e et al. 2015)? What is the linking hypothesis between adjective order and
  perceptual features that adjectives denote (Belke 2006)? We invite submis
 sions that present language-specific\, cross-linguistic/comparative\, and 
 experimental work on adjective order. We especially encourage submissions 
 of relevant pragmatics and corpus work.\n\nConfirmed Invited Speakers:\n\n

 .\n\nVorgestellt werden empirisch orientierte Projekte aus allen Bereichen
  der Linguistik (theoretische und deskriptive Linguistik sowie Psycho-\, N
 euro-\, Sozio- oder Computerlinguistik\, synchron wie diachron). Das Progr
 amm wird ergänzt durch Workshops (z.B. Praat\, Statistik mit R)\, Gastvor
 träge und kulturelle Aktivitäten.\n\nEs sollen in einem informellen Rahm
 en methodische Herausforderungen diskutiert werden. An Stelle inhaltlicher
  Diskussionen liegt der Fokus der STaPs auf einem starken Problem- und Met
 hodenbezug: Weder fertige Forschung noch vorläufige (Teil-)Ergebnisse sol
 len präsentiert werden. Deshalb richtet sich die STaPs besonders auch an 
 Promovierende in der Anfangsphase.\n\n

  social science perspectives (ROMPOL) − our group has chosen the theme P
 olitical Discourse and the Extremes. Whereas the main focus during the fir
 st workshop was on political debates in the oral media\, this second editi
 on will include any form of texts carrying political messages: news media\
 , blogs\, pamphlets\, contemporary fictional or non-fictional works\, soci
 al media sites\, etc. The intention is also to further explore the followi

 nifestations in Romance speaking countries in Europe as well as in Latin A
 merica\n- Identities\, racism and discrimination\n- Ideologies and religio
 ns\n\nOur intention is to use linguistic as well as social and historical 
 perspectives and involve scholars from various fields in the humanities an
 d the social sciences. Our main research idea is based on the assumption t
 hat knowledge and understanding of political discourse is best achieved wi
 th an interdisciplinary stance\, through collaboration between the discipl
 ines of linguistics and social sciences.\n\nInvited lecturers (the four fo

SUMMARY:The Development of Argument-Marking Systems
DTSTART;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20160331T000000

DESCRIPTION:The Development of Argument-Marking Systems\n\nInvited speaker
 s: Jóhanna Barðdal (Ghent University) and Remi van Trijp (Sony lab Paris
 )\n\nA fundamental task for language is to provide the rules to map meanin
 g to form. In the communication of an event\, these rules should link sema
 ntic and  information-structural roles\, such as agent\, patient\, and top
 ic\, to their grammatical functions\, such as subject and object. Despite 
 their importance for communication\, grammatical strategies of argument ma
 rking (viz. word order\, head marking\, and dependent marking) seem surpri
 singly limited and redundant\, and complex at the same time.\n\nRather tha
 n studying individual argument-marking strategies\, the focus of this work
 shop is on their joint usage and interaction\, taking a systemic perspecti
 ve. For example\, in Hungarian changes in word order were made possible by
  the development of case marking (E. Kiss 2013) and in North American lang
 uages\, word order is strict in the absence of bound person marking (Mithu
 n 1991). Relevant questions are: Why do languages not use a simple and str
 aightforward means of encoding who did what to whom? How did languages end
  up doing what they do? How did argument-marking strategies first emerge a
 nd how do they interact?\n\nThe goal of this workshop is to try to bridge 
 the gap between what can be hypothesized about the earliest emergence of a
 rgument marking (Jackendoff 2002) and (reconstructing) the oldest stages o
 f natural languages (Barddal to appear)\, with a special interest in using
  computational modeling (van Trijp 2012).\n\nThis workshop is organized as
  part of the NWO-funded project The exaptation of argument marking (PI San
 der Lestrade).\n\nReferences:\n\nK. E. Kiss (2013)\, From Proto-Hungarian

  (Humboldt-University Berlin)\n\nThe syntax of argument structure has been
  the focus of a number of empirical studies investigating phenomena such a
 s the causative alternation (Fadlon 2014)\, unaccusativity (Keller & Sorac
 e 2003\, Hirsch & Wagner 2011\, Irwin 2013\, Verhoeven & Kügler 2014)\, e
 rgativity (Longenbaugh & Polinsky 2013)\, argument hierarchies and argumen

 he dative alternation (Bresnan et al. 2007)\, inherent vs. structural case
  (Jacobsen 2000\, Bayer et al. 2001)\, psych predicates (Lamers & de Hoop 
 2014\, Verhoeven 2014\, 2015)\, etc. \n\nSuch studies provide interesting 
 but potentially controversial contributions to linguistic theory: some dis
 cover gradience in the verbal lexicon that can only be precisely measured 
 with quantitative methods (see e.g.\, Keller & Sorace 2003)\; others claim
  that properties attributed to verbal syntax are an epiphenomenon of other
  layers of grammar (see e.g.\, Hirsch & Wagner 2011)\; yet other studies s
 how reflexes of core properties of verbal syntax in processing (see e.g. P
 olinsky et al. 2012 on ergativity).\n\nLinguistic Fields: General Linguist

 \nWhat is ANLP?:\n\nThe track on Applied Natural Language Processing is a 
 forum for researchers working in natural language processing(NLP)/computat
 ional linguistics(CL) and related areas. The rapid pace of development of 
 online materials\, most of them in textual form or text combined with othe
 r media (visual\, audio)\, has led to a revived interest for tools capable
  to understand\, organize and mine those materials. Novel human-computer i
 nterfaces\, for instance talking heads\, can benefit from language underst
 anding and generation techniques with big impact on user satisfaction. Mor
 eover\, language can facilitate human-computer interaction for the handica
 pped (no typing needed) and elderly leading to an ever increasing user bas
 e for computer systems.\n\nGoal of ANLP:\n\nThe goal of the ANLP track is 
 to inform researchers as to current project and studies that identify\, in
 vestigate\, and (begin to) resolve issues that relate to human/computer la
 nguage interaction.

DESCRIPTION:Learners of a second or foreign language are not homogeneous w
 ith regard to their linguistic backgrounds and their degree of fluency in 
 different languages. Students often have skills in more than one language\
 , including languages previously studied at school\, as well as heritage a
 nd minority languages. These skills can range from basic conversational sk
 ills to fully developed cognitive academic language proficiency (CALP). Te
 achers are expected to diagnose the different needs of all pupils and cate
 r for them in the mainstream classroom. CALL – computer assisted languag
 e learning – can potentially contribute to this.\n\nOnline interactions 
 that bring together speakers of different languages\, for example telecoll
 aboration and virtual tandems\, can add depth and complexity to a language
  learning setting. Who speaks which language to whom and when? Why? Is cod
 e-switching permissible? Many decisions regarding language choice are made
  by teachers and learners alike\, but which “language choice designs”\
 , which “language choice strategies” are most beneficial for learners?
 \n\nDespite these relevant questions\, very little research has been condu
 cted on multilingual CALL. Usually\, issues of multilingual language pract
 ices in CALL are mentioned only in passing\, often based on the assumption
  that they constitute a problem that needs to be addressed. Sometimes\, un
 spoken assumptions about a monolingual ideal in language instruction (cf G
 ogolin 1994\, Butzkamm 1973) permeate CALL designs – but these assumptio
 ns are rarely empirically tested or theoretically challenged.\n\nThis conf
 erence aims to increase the awareness of the existence and functions of mu
 ltilingual materials and multilingual language use in CALL contexts. Furth
 ermore\, it will contribute to a critical assessment on widespread assumpt
 ions regarding monolingual/multilingual practices in CALL.\n\nButzkamm\, W

DESCRIPTION:Because contemporary approaches to morphological analysis atte
 nd to different dimensions of a language’s morphological system\, there 
 are often stark differences in the work to which these approaches give ris
 e. Contemporary morphologists often ask different kinds of questions about
  the morphological systems that they investigate\, making very different a
 ssumptions\n\n- about a morphological system’s internal architecture and
  external interfaces\n- about the kinds of units and relations in terms of
  which a language’s morphology is defined\n- about the kinds of data nec
 essary for analyzing a language’s morphology and the logical paths from 
 this data to the resulting analysis\n- about the relation between diachron
 ic pressures and synchronic patterns\n- about cognitive constraints on mor
 phology and their manifestation in a morphological system’s organization
 \n- about the dimensions of typological variation in morphology and about 
 the forces that engender this diversity.\n\nThe goal of the AnaMorphoSys W
 orkshop is to identify and discuss the contrasting principles of morpholog
 ical analysis that underlie contemporary work on morphology.\n\nInvited Sp
 eakers:\n\nThe workshop will feature three keynote presentations on princi
 ples underlying differing approaches to morphological analysis. Each of th
 ese presentations will initiate a discussion between the invited keynote s

 f such conference is taking place in October\, this year and the theme is 
 “Multilingualism in Africa: Resource or Challenge”.\n\nThe theme for t
 he conference is motivated by the highly multilingual setting that Africa 
 finds itself in and the debates about whether or not the multilingual natu
 re of African countries has contributed to the low economic performance of
  Africa.  Questions such as: \n\n- Does the use of African languages have 
 any advantage for Africa?\n- What languages should African countries use i
 n education?\n- Do we need national languages in addition to the official 
 language?\n\nThese are some of the questions African countries have been g
 rappling with since independence. The theme for the conference is therefor
 e\, to open the forum for further discussion on whether multilingualism in
  Africa has any prospects and what the challenges are.\n\nPapers on core l
 inguistics\, applied linguistics\, modern languages and literature will al
 so feature during the conference\, since language development\, language d
 ocumentation and literature play important roles in national development.

DESCRIPTION:The fifth biennial conference on Current Approaches to Spanish
  and Portuguese Second Language Phonology (CASPSLaP 2016) will be held at 
 The Ohio State University in Columbus on April 15-17\, 2016. CASPSLaP brin
 gs together leading experts in the field of the second language acquisitio
 n (SLA) of Spanish and Portuguese pronunciation. The presentations will in
 clude a wide range of topics\, from the acquisition of Spanish phonology b
 y English speakers\, to the acquisition of Portuguese phonology by Spanish
  speakers\; from classroom-based learning to full immersion in the second-
 language culture\; among various other topics. By focusing on the breadth 
 of approaches currently taken by scholars researching the acquisition of S
 panish and Portuguese L2 phonology\, this conference aims to present the s
 tate-of-the-art in second language phonological acquisition.\n\nIn additio
 n to the general session\, the conference will feature two special session
 s on the L2 acquisition of prosody and the phonology of heritage speakers\
 , both with invited discussants. There will also be a poster session\, as 
 well as an interactive\, pedagogy-focused session called Ignite that addre
 sses best practices in classroom pronunciation instruction. CASPSLAP 2016 
 will be held in concert with the OSU Congress on Hispanic and Lusophone Li
 nguistics (OSUCHiLL).

DESCRIPTION:The American Comparative Literature Association's 2016 Annual 
 Meeting will take place at Harvard University in Cambridge\, Massachusetts
  March 17-20\, 2016.\n\nThe ACLA's annual conferences have a distinctive s
 tructure in which most papers are grouped into twelve-person seminars that
  meet two hours per day for three days of the conference to foster extende
 d discussion. Some eight-person (or smaller) seminars meet just the first 
 two days of the conference. This structure allows each participant to be a
  full member of one seminar\, and to sample other seminars during the rema
 ining time blocks. Depending on space availability\, we may also consider 
 accepting a limited number of one-day seminars\, especially if they are in
 novative either in presentation format or in terms of theme. The conferenc
 e also includes plenary sessions\, workshops and roundtable discussions\, 
 and other events.

DESCRIPTION:This conference is associated with the project Linguistic Comp
 lexity in the Individual and Society (LCIS\; http://www.ntnu.edu/lcis) at 
 the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim. Th
 e goal of LCIS is to study linguistic complexity in three different areas:
  formal grammar\, language acquisition\, and sociolinguistics. The groundb
 reaking part of this project is that it will attempt to combine these diff
 erent sub-disciplines of modern linguistics. Different methodologies and t
 heoretical perspectives will be useful in order to illuminate complementar
 y aspects of language complexity and thus contribute to deepening our unde
 rstanding of this phenomenon. A unifying aspect of the research is the use
  of multilingual data. These data have become increasingly important for l
 inguistic methodologies and theories\, but also for public policy makers i
 n the sense that they address consequences of migration and children growi
 ng up acquiring parts of multiple languages.\n\nThe present two-day confer
 ence on October 15-16\, 2015 will feature talks addressing linguistic comp
 lexity within the three areas mentioned above: formal grammar\, language a
 cquisition\, and sociolinguistics. The following speakers have kindly agre

DESCRIPTION:The Sociolinguistics of Call Centres: How can twenty years of 
 call centre research shed light on current issues in sociolinguistics?\n\n
 Over the past decades\, call centres have shot up exponentially across the
  world. Their particularities have attracted considerable interest from th
 e public\, the media as well as researchers across a wide range of discipl
 ines\, including sociologists\, anthropologists\, business scholars\, orga
 nizational psychologists and linguists.\n\nSocio- and applied linguists ha
 ve taken a particular interest in aspects such as scripting\, textualisati
 on\, commodification and metadiscursive regimes (Heller 2003\; Cameron 200
 0\, 2008\; Hultgren and Cameron 2010a\, 2010b\; Woydack & Rampton 2015)\, 
 multilingualism (Duchêne 2009\; Alarcón and Heyman 2013)\, gender (Camer
 on 2000b\; Forey 2013\;\, Heller 2007\; Hultgren 2008)\, accent neutraliza
 tion (Cowie 2008)\, cultural identity (Mirchandani 2004\, 2012\; Poster 20
 07\; Sonntag 2009\; Duchêne & Heller 2012)\, conversation analysis (Baker
  et al. 2005) and politeness (Archer and Jagodziński 2014\; Hultgren 2011
 ). Some have adopted an applied perspective\, trying to provide suggestion
 s as to how to improve call centre interactions (Lockwood 2012\; Lockwood 
 and Forey 2007\; Friginal 2009).\n\nCall centre agents are under pressure 
 to process calls quickly as well as providing a personalized customer serv
 ice\, a tension which needs to be managed linguistically and which\, in th
 e case of off-shore call centres\, may be exacerbated by the interaction t
 ranscending national\, linguistic and cultural borders. While sociologists
  have studies call centres as a way to shed light on key sociological them
 es such as rationalisation\, post-Fordism\, standardisation\, social class
  and gender\, the potential for call centres to illuminate key themes in s
 ociolinguistics is vast. \n\nBringing together researchers working on call
  centres of different types (inhouse\, offshore\, outbound and inbound) an
 d on different continents (Asia\, South America\, and Europe)\, the aim of
  the proposed colloquium is to discuss and make visible the types of theor
 etical and practical insights linguistic research on call centres can brin
 g to sociolinguistics and applied linguistics. As workplaces with low stat
 us and a poor societal reputation\, they provide a potentially illuminatin
 g window into the conference theme of attitudes and prestige.

DESCRIPTION:Boundaries define who we are and who we are not. They unite an
 d divide us. They exist within us\, and are external to us. Some are even 
 created by us. Boundaries take on many forms - linguistic\, literary\, and
  cultural\; they are an integral part of human life. \n\nThis year’s con
 ference\, contemplating the theme of boundaries within the linguistic dive
 rsity in Wales and other Welsh speaking areas\, aims to provide a forum fo
 r those interested in discussing these issues. Following on from the succe
 ss of last year’s conference\, this year’s event will once again be a 
 symposium dealing with linguistics\, history\, literary studies\, and othe
 r areas relevant for language diversity in Welsh-speaking areas. The forum
  is open to researchers interested in translation studies\, media studies\
 , arts\, and anthropology insofar as they are working on topics connected 
 with the language diversity of Wales.\n\nWe welcome participants dealing w
 ith diversity in Welsh\, English or any other languages that are or have b
 een used in Wales (e.g. French\, Latin\, Flemish\, Polish\, Romani\, Somal
 i\, sign language\, etc.) and areas where Welsh is spoken (e.g. Patagonia\
 , and regions of Britain other than Wales). Within the field of literary s
 tudies\, possible topics include: the use of Welsh in English-medium liter
 ature\, the use of English in Welsh-medium literature\, and the use of dia
 lects in Welsh literature.\n\nRecent history has seen a blurring of the tr
 aditional boundaries of the linguistic\, literary\, cultural\, and politic
 al lives of Wales\; we invite you to take part in the discussion\, explora
 tion\, and possible reshaping of these once firm concepts.  \n\nThe regis
 tration fee will be c. £25 (to be confirmed).\n\nShould you have any ques
 tions\, please contact us at amrywiaeth@gmail.com or visit the website and

DESCRIPTION:Competence – Function – Variation. Linguistica Coseriana V
 . International Conference at the University of Potsdam\, October 8-10\, 2
 015\n\nIn recent years\, four international conferences have taken place t
 hat were dedicated to the language-theoretical legacy of Eugenio Coseriu: 
 2007 in Aix-en-Provence (France)\, 2009 in Cluj (Romania)\, 2011 in Almer
 ía (Spain) and 2013 in Udine (Italy). We not only take up the concerns of
  these conferences\, but rather want to stimulate the discussion on the pr
 esent research in the field of the concepts ‛competence’\, ‛function
 ’ and ‛variation’. \n\nThe term competence not only includes the kno
 wledge of the system of a single language\, but in addition to this idioma
 tic knowledge also the general-linguistic\, elocutional knowledge and the 
 expressive knowledge of discourse competence. Inspired by generative theor
 y\, Coseriu coined the term competence\, which is essential in linguistics
  of parole. Linguistic knowledge was defined by Coseriu in the Leibnizian 
 sense as cognitio clara distincta inadaequata\, i.e. it explained the obje
 ct of knowledge not as reflective\, but as clear and identifying the objec
 t distinctly. \n\nMany directions of linguistics claim to describe the fun
 ction of linguistic units\, often without being aware of each other or wit
 hout developing an awareness of the polysemy of the word function in lingu
 istics. For Coseriu\, functions are based on structures\, and additionally
  he is interested in functional categories and functions of forms. The con
 cept of a 'functional language' combines the language-internal functions o
 f structures of the langue with the language-external\, communicative func
 tions of functional languages in the parole. \n\nWith his model of diatopi
 c\, diastratic\, diaphasic and diachronic variation\, Coseriu created a st
 arting point for variation-linguistic research\, which was widely taken up
  and developed further. In particular\, with the assumption of transitiona
 l forms between oral and written language and language of nearness and dis
 tance\, distinct forms\, but intertwining as gradata\, the possibilities o
 f a differentiated analysis of linguistic variation increase.\n\nVenue: Ca

DESCRIPTION:The field of Experimental Pragmatics was founded by the public
 ation of Noveck & Sperber (2004) who confidently wrote: ''this volume lays
  down the bases for a new field\, Experimental Pragmatics\, that draws on 
 pragmatics\, psycholinguistics and also on the psychology of reasoning.'' 
 The bold prediction has proven remarkable accurate: Experimental Pragmatic
 s has since successfully established itself as an independent field of res
 earch\, providing a new perspective on age-old pragmatic problems and insp
 iring new lines of inquiry. In addition to the fields Noveck & Sperber abo
 ve mentioned\, also semantics\, neuroscience and philosophy have contribut
 ed to Experimental Pragmatics\, but also been influenced by it.\n\nAlmost 
 a dozen years later\, this workshop aims to stake out new directions for E

DESCRIPTION:This conference will be a forum for contrastive studies (with 
 an emphasis on English). The theme of contrast intended to include any int
 er- or intra- linguistic variation. Therefore\, studies that contrast diff
 erent geographic\, sociolinguistic\, or historical varieties just as studi
 es that contrast entire languages are welcome. From comparative grammar to
  variationist sociolinguistics and critical discourse analysis\, the use o
 f contrast in language science is an established heuristic. By confronting
  different languages or varieties of the same language\, the organizers ho
 pe to bring to better bring to light previously unnoticed phenomena or to 
 gain improved understanding of well-known phenomena. Studies on any facet 
 of English are welcome (from phonetics to pragmatics\, from a diachronic o
 r synchronic perspective\, concerning acquisition or translation\, quantit
 ative analyses\, etc.)\, the only requirement being that study be empirica
 l and contrastive in approach: \n\n- Comparing English and another languag
 e\n- Comparing one variety of English with one or more sociolinguistic var
 ieties of English \n- Comparing contemporary English with one or more hist
 orical varieties of English\n\nPlenary Speakers:\n\nEric Corre & Debra Zie

  Like previous workshops\, NEW7 will focus on research on the linguistic '
 North'\, specifically Northern England (from the English-Scottish border t
 o as far south as you can justify)\, but will exclude research dealing wit
 h Scotland and Ireland (unless this concerns relations with Northern Engla

SUMMARY:Workshop on Romance Se/Si

DESCRIPTION:A workshop on Romance SE/SI constructions will be held on Apri
 l 21 and 22\, 2016 at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\nThe reflexiv
 e (SE/SI) clitic is one of the most widely studied topics in Romance Lingu
 istics\, both in traditional descriptions and theoretical analyses. This s
 tems\, in part\, from the vast range of constructions in which the clitic 
 may appear\, including reflexives\, reciprocals\, impersonals\, passives\,
  middles\, anti-causatives\, as a marker of telicity with some verbs (aspe
 ctual SE/SI)\, as an inherent part of a certain class of intransitive verb
 s called ‘pronominal verbs’ (inherent SE/SI)\, and\, in part\, from th
 e range of theoretical issues it bears on\, including argument structure\,
  the lexicon-syntax interface\, the morphology-syntax interface\, movement
 \, agreement\, Case\, binding theory\, and (parametric) variation.\n\nThe 
 search for a “common core” that triggers fundamentally the same morpho
 logical reflex (= SE/SI) in all of these constructions is something that h
 as alluded grammarians and linguists alike and continues to be a fundament
 al guiding question in current research (see Sánchez López 2002\, Dobrov
 ie-Sorin 2006 and Mendikoetxea 2012 for the most recent overviews). While 
 the “common core” question is a key component of research on Romance S
 E/SI\, detailed research on individual SE/SI constructions is just as impo
 rtant as it clarifies our understanding of the nuances of each environment
  where SE/SI appears and thus leads us toward a better understanding of pr
 ecisely what they all have in common and also where they differ.\n\nA rela
 ted important question concerns variation within Romance languages. Not al
 l Romance languages have all of the SE/SI constructions mentioned above (s
 ee Zubizarreta 1982\, Cinque 1988\, Mendikoetxea & Battye 1990\, Dobrovie-
 Sorin 1998\, D’Alessandro 2007)\, nor do all the “same” SE/SI constr
 uctions behave the same way in all languages (Cinque 1988\, Dobrovie-Sorin
  1998). While variation is recognized to exist\, the question remains whet
 her this variation can be given a principled explanation. This question is
  especially important within a Minimalist climate\, where the nature and l
 ocus of variation raises deep theoretical questions about the architecture
  of the grammar (see Sigurdsson 2004\, Baker 2008\, Boeckx 2011 among othe
 rs).

SUMMARY:Rhetoric And The Forms Of European Culture: From Tradition To Cont
 emporary Challenges

DTEND;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20160507T000000
UID:http://linguistlist.org/issues/26/26-5013.html
DESCRIPTION:Today one of the privileged domains for research and bringing 
 up-to-date rhetoric is cultural studies\, which consider it not only as a 
 social and linguistic phenomenon\, but also as a cultural tool for the exe
 rcise of freedom in democracy. An epistemic rupture\, which occurred in Eu
 rope on the threshold of the 18th and 19th centuries\, resulted in the gra
 dual abandonment of the rhetoric background that had prevailed until then.
  The analysis of recent developments shows\, in many ways\, a continuous t
 endency to minimize or obscure the consequences of such an abandonment. Th
 ese consequences are related to the means at our disposal – especially t
 he discursive ones – to orient ourselves and to make decisions in a hazy
 \, uncertain\, precarious world\, while mobilizing resources of practical 
 reason. Indeed\, as the philosopher Chaïm Perelman said\, it is above all
  the ''contempt for rhetoric'' and ''forgetting the theory of argumentatio
 n\, [which] led to the negation of practical reason''\; led\, in one way o
 r another\, to the war and contempt for people. Let’s admit\, rhetoric c
 an not be the prerogative of self-proclaimed ‘experts’ or the preserve
  of language specialists. Rhetoric\, as Aristotle already assured\, is a s
 kill shared by all people\; common to all citizens. A skill that is import
 ant precisely to learn to attend to in order to master it. Everyone should
  be able to build in conscience on the ancient technè of discourse in ord
 er to defend oneself and to accuse\; to engage in or refuse the engagement
 \; and not to remain without a voice other than that of violence. Without 
 a concrete mastery of cultural tools of rhetoric\, speech is doomed to bei
 ng practiced haphazardly\, without any method and\, above all\, without co
 nscience. This is what we need to investigate as part of this conference.\
 n\nParticular attention will be paid to the following issues:\n\n- Hasn’
 t the doom of rhetoric contributed to making it even more difficult the re
 sumption of universal forms of European culture?\n- Is the practice of rhe
 toric a way to guard against fatal diversions of the facade consensus and 
 the hollow verb?\n- In what sense can rhetoric give access to European cul
 tural sources capable to provide the contemporary public discourse with cu
 lturally richer intertexts?\n- Can the concept of the sublime\, formulated
  in antiquity\, help us to overcome the pathetic dimension and declarative
  grandiloquence of contemporary public discourse?\n- Is rhetoric\, as taug
 ht at universities\, engaged in the cultural tradition from which it spran
 g? Does the way we understand it meet the needs of a truly humanist citize
 n education?\n- How to transmit the tools of rhetoric today? And why? To w
 hat extent does the apprenticeship of uncertainty and vulnerability consti
 tute an issue of rhetoric and also a prime challenge for democracy?\n\nOn

DESCRIPTION:Besides the recursive and typically asymmetric concatenation o
 f lexical material\, replication (i.e.\, copying doubling\, repetition and
  structure sharing) constitutes the second major mechanism of structure bu
 ilding in natural language. Replicative processes are pervasive in all are
 as of grammar ranging from phonological segment splitting and harmony over
  reduplication and affix doubling to syntactic copying\, but also abstract
  replication of function as in coalescence and elliptic constructions wher
 e a single grammatical entity serves double duty.\n\nWhereas replicative p
 rocesses have played a central role in the major theoretical developments 
 of the last decades – cf. the importance of the operation Agree in Minim
 alist syntax (Chomsky 2000\, 2001) and of reduplication for optimality-the
 oretic Correspondence Theory (McCarthy & Prince 1994\, 1995) – many type
 s of replication are still poorly understood. Thus it is still largely unc
 lear whether affix copying processes (Inkelas and Zoll 2005\, Bickel et al
 . 2007\, Zimmermann 2012) are motivated morphologically or phonologically 
 and how they relate to another huge but underresearched area of replicatio
 n\, extended exponence (Anderson 2002\, Müller 2007\, Caballero & Harris 
 2012)\, we are still far from a general theory of verb copying constructio
 ns (Kandybowicz 2008\, 2013)\, and the development of the Agreement-by-Cor
 respondence approach to phonological harmony processes (Hansson 2001\, Ros
 e & Walker 2004\, Bennett 2015) has raised as least as many new questions 
 as it solves.\n\nInvited Speakers:\n\nJonathan Bobaljik (University of Con

SUMMARY:Standardization of 'Arabiyya and Amazigh in Comparative Perspectiv

DESCRIPTION:The conference is organized jointly by the Faculty of Educatio
 n\, Rabat\, and the Department of Middle East Studies\, UT\, Austin.\n\nTh
 e conference compares the standardization of Arabic in the 8th century and
  the ongoing standardization of Berber in North African countries.\n\nThe 
 organizers invite scholars interested in Arabic\, Amazigh and the phenomen
 on of language standardization to compare the standardization of Classical
  Arabic (i.e. „Arabiyya) during the first and second centuries A.H (VIII
  and IX A.D.) and the ongoing standardization of Amazigh in North African 
 countries. The main reason behind the choice of this topic is that the soc
 ial\, the political and the religious circumstances that motivated and dir
 ected the standardization Classical Arabic are still not well-understood. 
 Arab and Muslim scholars have long been content with some ideas advanced i
 n the IV century A.H according to which Classical Arabic corresponds to th
 e Qurayshi variety. Western scholars also have not given much interest to 
 the phenomenon\, though many of them expressed opinions in this regard whi
 ch remained scattered in their writings. Therefore\, the organizers of the
  Rabat-Austin workshops on Arabic hope that scholars will seize the opport
 unity to discuss the issue deeply in the light of traditional Arabic sourc
 es as well as recent scholarship on language standardization in general.\n
 \nLanguage standardization in the past can be approached better through co
 mparison with similar processes happening in the present. One case of lang
 uage standardization taking place in the Arab-Muslim world is Amazigh (Ber
 ber)\, the language of the original inhabitants of North Africa. What is i
 nteresting about the Amazigh case is that its standardization is happening
  within a cultural context deeply influenced by Arabic traditional views o
 f language\, linguistic variation and linguistic standards. The name „Am
 azigh‟ today refers to a large set of varieties many of which are not mu
 tually intelligible. Yet\, Amazigh activists in Morocco\, for example\, in
 sist on the unity of their language in their discourse with their communit
 y as well as with the state. Why do we witness such strong tendency toward
  unity? What about the relation between trans-national Amazigh varieties a
 nd movements? What effect has the Arabo-Islamic linguistic culture on the 
 Amazigh standardization discourse? etc. These and similar questions can gi
 ve rise to a fruitful debate about language standardization in general\, a
 nd language standardization in an Arabo-Islamic setting in particular.

DESCRIPTION:Versification describes the marriage of language and meter: it
  is the key to the production of poetry. This phenomenon attracts research
 ers from a wide variety of intersecting disciplines\, ranging from metrici
 sts proper and researchers of cognitive poetics to scholars of folklore\, 
 linguistics\, linguistic anthropology\, literature\, musicology\, philolog
 y and more. Meter is often discussed abstractly as the formalization of ho
 w words\, sounds and sometimes also semantics relate to rhythm\, yet poeti
 c meter cannot exist without instantiation through language and a connecti
 on with social language practice. The 2016 NordMetrik conference brings fo
 cused attention precisely here\, on versification as metrics in practice. 
 \n\nBy bringing together the insights and perspectives from different disc
 iplines on the many facets of versification\, our aim is to stimulate mult
 idisciplinary discussion in order to negotiate shared understanding leadin
 g to new knowledge. No natural language in human history has been without 
 poetry. This fact suggests that versification is somehow fundamental to cu
 lture\, and underscores the importance of subjecting this phenomenon to co
 ncentrated discussion. \n\nKeynote Speakers:\n\n- Paul Kiparsky (Stanford

DESCRIPTION:Convenors: Paola Cotticelli-Kurras (Università di Verona)\, E
 ugen Hill (Universität Köln)\n\nIntroduction:\n\nThe workshop aims at pr
 omoting the discussion among linguists who are interested in the phenomena
  of contact and interference between languages\, on the different levels o
 n which such interactions may occur (phonology\, morphology\, syntax\, lex
 icon\, semantics\, pragmatics). We expect the discussion to provide new in
 sights into the various issues of linguistic change as a result of contact
 \, therefore we will focus on the diachronic perspective of contact invest
 igation.\n\nMotivations and Aims:\n\nLanguage contact is one of the main m
 echanisms triggering and influencing linguistic change (Weinreich 1953\; G
 usmani 1993\; Thomason 2001\; Winford 2003\; Aichenvald\, Dixon 2006\; Deu
 mert\, Durrleman 2006\; Berruto 2009). It manifests irself on several diff
 erent levels: in lexical loans\, of course\, (e.g. Bombi 2005\; Mauri\, Gi
 acalone-Ramat\, Molinelli 2013)\, but also in the innovation of grammar (M
 yers-Scotton 2002\; Heine\, Kuteva 2005\; Bakker\, Hekking 2012\, Hill 201
 3 and Hill 2015) or at the phonological level (Schrijver 2014). In the dom
 ain of historical languages\, it also plays an important role in translati
 on texts (e.g. Cotticelli-Kurras 2006\; Cotticelli-Kurras et al.\, ed.\, 2
 012). The aim of the Workshop is to bring together scholars dealing with s
 everal aspects of language contact from different perspectives\, comparing
  the methodologies applied to the study of ancient (written) as well as mo
 dern languages.\n\nFrom the perspective of language change\, (epi)phenomen
 a of (diaphasic\, diamesic\, diastratic\, diatopic and diachronic) variati
 on will be investigated\, as they emerge in ancient and modern languages. 
 They may be highlighted through the assessment of graphic\, morpho-phonolo
 gical and lexical indicators\, as well as from the perspective of bilingua
 lism\, diglossia and code-switching\, evaluating the possible implications
  with respect to language mutation.\n\nProcesses of linguistic assimilatio
 n\, dissimilation or suppletion  will be investigated\, as they are operat
 ed by groups who aim at defining and proclaiming the existence of a lingui
 stic boundary. This phenomenon is also visible in the case of text transla
 tions\, which may reveal unexplored dynamics in the relationship between t
 wo (or more) cultures and languages.\n\nAs far as the diachrony of ancient
  language contact is concerned\, the theoretical correlate of all these ob
 jectives is the elaboration of interpretative models to assess the text so
 ciolinguistically\, verifying the possibility to inherit such models from 
 the framework of modern languages\, that offer a rich and varied documenta
 tion on the diastratic\, diamesic and diaphasic level\, whereas the ancien
 t ones are known only through written documents.\n\nAnalyzing ancient lang
 uage corpora\, but also modern ones\, with a quantitative and qualitative 
 integrated approach\, one of the goals is certainly observing phenomena su
 ch as frequency and saliency\, used to explain the processes of mutation. 
 In other words\, this means assigning a crucial role to the dynamic relati
 onship between synchrony and diachrony. A detailed analysis of the texts o
 n both the philological and the linguistic levels - in the context of thei
 r socio-historical implications - may provide interpretative keys to expla
 in the complexity of synchronic variation. At the same time\, it enables a
 n analysis of linguistic mutation\, which can be examined from the perspec
 tive of its socio-cultural environment.

SUMMARY:Diachronic and Functional Explanations in Linguistic Typology

DESCRIPTION:The aim of this workshop is to bring together historical lingu
 ists\, typologists\, functional linguists and other specialists to explore
  the role of diachronic evidence in establishing functional motivations.\n
 \nFunctional motivations have been assumed largely on the basis of synchro
 nic distributions (static evidence) and\, subsequently\, explained by cogn
 itive and/or processing principles. However\, it has been emphasized recen
 tly that establishing such a motivation is only possible when synchronic c
 orrelations are backed up with diachronic evidence. Cristofaro (2012) argu
 es\, for example\, that synchronic alignment systems found in a number of 
 languages in fact result from different language-specific diachronic chang
 es and are largely determined by the respective grammaticalization paths w
 ith no evidence for universals at any stage of the development. Thus\, par
 ticular patterns may simply reveal themselves as diachronically/etymologic
 ally biased towards a particular constellation\, in which case the assumpt
 ion of some underlying universal mechanism linking these patterns may beco
 me redundant (diachronic biases). Another example is Dispersion Theory in 
 phonology\, which seeks to explain cross-linguistic variation in vowel inv
 entories in terms of conflicting functional constraints operating at the s
 ynchronic level. As shown by Vaux & Samuels (2015)\, this theory fails to 
 explain a range of idiosyncratic phonological patterns and should be super
 seded by an evolutionary account (e.g. Blevins 2004).\n\nAt the same time\
 , the diachronic inquiry may provide dynamic evidence for or against a par
 ticular functional motivation or universal if one can demonstrate that the
 re is a particular development (or lack thereof) that makes a language inc
 reasingly adhere to the respective functional motivation or universal. Whi
 le the traditional typology is mainly based on static evidence without tak
 ing into account diachronic biases\, dynamic evidence is largely an unexpl
 ored field\, studies like Bickel et al. (2015) being an exception.\n\nThe 
 workshop will be part of the 49th annual meeting of the SLE in Naples\, Au
 gust 31 – September 3\, 2016.

DESCRIPTION:This two-day event focuses on action-research in and for learn
 er autonomy\, and addresses researchers as well as teachers-as-researchers
 . Through a series of talks\, workshops and interactive poster sessions\, 
 the conference will explore how research can be materialised and how we ca
 n enthuse our learners to become action-researchers themselves. The first 
 conference day will give researchers the opportunity to discuss contempora
 ry approaches to researching autonomy\, while during the second day teache
 rs will be engaged in developing frameworks and ideas for classroom action
 -research in which learners play an active role. A selection of conference
  papers and plans of action will be published as an e-book.\n\nPlenary Spe

DESCRIPTION:Our life stems from food and is based on food for its sustenan
 ce. Food enriches our cultures and social events. Googling the word ''food
 '' we get billions of results as well as millions of images\, all sorts of
  images\, most of them are positive\, colourful and joyous\, because the i
 mage we usually link to food is a positive one. However\, less frequent\, 
 but equally present are images which link food to hunger or eating disorde
 rs\, problems that characterize our time and are part of our world.\n\nFoo
 d is definitely part of our life and its role is growing continuously\, th
 anks to the huge number of TV shows\, such as Master Chef or Bake off\, co
 okery books\, magazines available and to the increasing interest in people
 ’s eating habits\, dietary requirements\, produce growing and health. Mi
 lan EXPO 2015 itself can be taken as an example of how central food is in 
 this time of ours\; the interest the Universal Exhibition pays to food pol
 itics\, food waste\, GM food\, sustainability is evident from its motto: F
 eeding the Planet\, Energy for Life.\n\nIn addition\, food is what people 
 like to talk about very often. Language is\, consequently\, strictly relat
 ed and tied to food\, it is to be used to talk\, write\, discuss and sprea
 d food and cultures. Food is often associated to social events and religio
 us practices\, it is so culture bound that adapting and translating food r
 elated texts is particularly challenging. Accurate and informed translatio
 ns are more and more requested and needed.\n\nDespite all this\, however\,
  the relationship between food\, culture and translation remains under-res
 earched.\n\nBy highlighting these issues\, and following the first success
 ful international conference on Food and Culture in Translation (FaCT) hel
 d in Bologna- Bertinoro in 2014\, the second edition of FaCT\, to be held 
 in Catania (Sicily)\, aims to be a truly interdisciplinary conference that
  brings together scholars engaged in using food-related topics as a case i
 n point for their research. Located in the middle of the Mediterranean are
 a\, Catania is the perfect place to host a conference on food and cultures
 . Here\, different cultures have intermingled during the centuries leaving
  special flavours in the local cooking that is characterized by Arabian sp
 ices and local essences\, here people from different places have settled t
 o live together peacefully\, blending their cultures happily. Catania’s 
 unique character\, which is neither fully European nor African or Maghrebi
 an\, is eager to welcome researchers and scholars.\n\nThis interdisciplina
 ry conference acknowledges the importance of investigating food as a key p
 henomenon across various areas of society\, language and culture. This con
 ference sets out to explore the delicate balance and subtle boundaries bet
 ween food and translation\, between food and migration\, food and social a
 nd religious practices\, between food and history\, and other issues relat
 ed to food trans-location\, which seem to be one fundamental ingredient of
  modern multicultural societies.\n\nThe Conference will address a range of
  critically important issues relating to food as a cultural and social phe
 nomenon that travels across languages\, cultures and across time and space

SUMMARY:SLE Workshop: Bad Data: Methodological Aspects in Historical Socio
 linguistics

DESCRIPTION:When dealing with ancient languages\, some of the most relevan
 t problems one has to face result from the fact that every investigation i
 s necessarily constrained by a finite\, closed corpus of written attestati
 ons. But a mere transposition of methods and procedures from Corpus Lingui
 stics to the study of ancient languages would be clearly inadequate. A rep
 resentative corpus can be duly designed for the investigation of specific 
 aspects of living languages\, but the corpus of an ancient language «surv
 ive[s] by chance\, not by design» (Labov\, 1994: 11)\, and it is often a 
 collection of fragmentary and skewed data – either in part (e.g. Latin\,
  Ancient Greek) or in their entirety (e.g. Sabellic languages). Thus\, the
  reliability of such data cannot be separated from a qualitative approach\
 , which is often philological in nature.\n\nThis is in line with the well 
 known definition of Historical Linguistics «as the art of making the best
  use of bad data» (Labov\, 1994: 11). Labov’s statement\, which is an o
 men and a caveat at the same time\, raises a number of issues that are eve
 n more significant in Historical Sociolinguistics\, i.e. the branch of lan
 guage studies where «historical linguistics and sociolinguistics form a n
 atural class rather than an uneasy forced alliance» (Joseph\, 2012: 15)\,
  and where they necessarily share practices and research questions. In par
 ticular\, tracing the development of the field of Historical Sociolinguist
 ics\, Auer et al. (2015) highlight that any attempt to know something abou
 t the social distribution of linguistic features in the past is burdened b
 y the so-called ‘bad data’ problem.\n\nThe workshop aims at discussing
  the implications of the ‘bad data’ problem and other related issues f
 or the current linguistic research about ancient languages\, with particul
 ar reference to the Graeco-Roman world. \n\nReferences:\n\nAuer\, A.\, Pee

DESCRIPTION:Background:\n\nMore and more dictionaries are becoming availab
 le online\; the electronic medium allows lexicographers to adapt the data 
 offer of dictionaries to the needs of the dictionary users\, as well as to
  their knowledge of the language(s) dealt with. The necessary requirements
  have been formulated\, for example\, by the Lexicographic Function Theory
  (cf. Tarp 2008\, 2012)\; number of information presentation devices have 
 been discussed by information scientists (cf. Bothma 2011) and applied in 
 research prototypes (cf. e.g. Verlinde 2014). In addition\, computational 
 linguistics is able to provide tools\, at least for some languages\, which
  facilitate the interaction of users with online dictionaries (e.g. morpho
 logical analysers\, corpus nalysis tools).\nThese developments lead to a t
 ighter integration of electronic dictionaries into tools for reading and w
 riting support\, as well as for language learning and training. \n\nIn the
  field of electronic lexicography\, the University of Hildesheim\, Institu
 te for Information Science and Natural Language Processing\, (IwiST)\, is 
 currently cooperating with the Universities of Pretoria and Stellenbosch\,
  with the South African distance learning University UNISA (University of 
 South Africa\, Pretoria) and with the University of Namibia Windhoek) on t
 he project SeLA (Scientific e-Lexicography for Africa)\, in the framework 
 of which proposals and design studies for the above topics have been made.
  SeLA’s focus is on the languages of South(ern) Africa\, but its finding
 s generalize to other languages as well. An additional special interest of
  SeLA is in intercultural science communication: how does mixed team of So
 uthern African and German scientists discuss the above issues?\n\nObjectiv
 es:\n\nAs research on electronic dictionaries is typically interdisciplina
 ry\, this conference is aimed at bringing experts from the relevant fields
  together: linguists\, especially Africanists\, lexicographers\, informati
 on scientists\, computational linguists\, computer scientists\, and expert
 s in intercultural communication.\n\nThe conference will serve to present 
 and discuss the current (2015) state of the art in the domain\, to present
  specific case studies\, and to jointly develop a road map for future acti
 vities in the field.\n\nDate and place of conference:\n\nWednesday\, 7 and

SUMMARY:Dealing with Bad Data in Linguistic Theory

DESCRIPTION:In recent years\, linguistic theory has significantly expanded
  its empirical scope. If it has indeed ever been true that theories were b
 uilt exclusively on the researcher’s own armchair judgements\, such is d
 efinitely no longer the case. More and more\, researchers have turned thei
 r attention to databases and corpora of all kinds\, to experimental result
 s\, and to many other types of data sources. This development went hand in
  hand with an expansion of the scope of the theories\, and collaborations 
 with e.g. historical linguistics\, dialectologists\, sociolinguists\, and 
 psycholinguists.\n\nWe believe that this is a positive development\; but w
 e also believe that some issues have not been sufficiently discussed. In t
 his workshop we aim to tackle the issue of how to deal with ‘bad data’
 : many data that we have to deal with has not been collected with exactly 
 the questions in mind that we want to ask. E.g.\, we have to use the resul
 ts of a dialect survey of a few decades ago as the money is lacking to set
  up a new survey\; or certain data are simply lacking for a particular his
 torical period.\n\nThe following speakers have confirmed their participati
 on: \n\n- Paul de Lacy\n- Paula Fikkert\n- Paul Kiparsky\n- Cecilia Polett
 o\n- Keren Rice\n- Christina Tortora\n- Jeroen Van Craenenbroeck\n- Charle

DESCRIPTION:The workshop aims to bring together linguists investigating sp
 eech acts or illocutionary acts\, such as assertions\, questions\, and ord
 ers (for a definition of speech acts\, see Bierwisch 1980\; Sadock & Zwick
 y 1985\; Recanati 1987\; Krifka 2014). The workshop is particularly intere
 sted in the relations among speech acts as well as their syntactic and pho
 nological encodings. Do different speech acts show specific phonological a
 nd/or syntactic patterns? As to the phonological side\, one important topi
 c is the intonation contour of speech acts (cf. D'Imperio et al. 2002\; Gi
 li-Fivela 2013\; Vanrell et al. 2013\; Truckenbrodt 2004\, 2015). What spe
 ech act-specific intonation contours do different languages exhibit\, and 
 how is the variation to be understood? How do phonological features contri
 bute to the perception and interpretation of speech acts?\n\nInvited Speak

SUMMARY:Rise of Complementizers

DESCRIPTION:The workshop addresses issues of the diachronic development of
  complementizers against other clause-linkage devices relevant for realis
 —irrealis distinctions and/or the lowering of assertiveness. The issues 
 fall into two groups. First\, we inquire how the distinction between compl
 ementizers and subjunctive markers can be compared crosslinguistically mor
 e coherently\, so that variation on a scale between free and bound morphem
 es and their relation to the aforementioned distinctions can be correlated
  with diachronic pathways. This is tantamount to asking whether ‘depende
 nt predicate markersʼ code “at the level of the D[ependent] C[lause] as
  a whole“ or only „at the level of its nucleus“ (van Lier 2009: 69f.
 ) and what conditions language-specific preferences for one of these codin
 g levels.\n\nSecond\, we ask for falsifiable methods suited to discern com
 plementizers from other connectives (like clause-initial particles)\, mark
 ing speaker’s stance\, quoted speech\, de dicto vs. de re-readings and s
 imilar distinctions. Thus\, while approaching a comparative concept of the
  notion ‘complementizerʼ\, we ask for diagnostic criteria and the theor
 etical premises that should be applied in historical morphosyntax\, semant
 ics and pragmatics\, but also in discourse-oriented studies on ongoing or 
 recent change interested in the identification of (potential) complementiz
 ers and how clausal complementation emerges from juxtaposition or adverbia
 l subordination. Especially this concerns the rise of complementizers used
  in contexts of event or propositional modality.\n\nFor the full version o

DESCRIPTION:A l’intersection des sciences du langage\, de la communicati
 on\, mais aussi des autres sciences sociales\, ce colloque propose d’int
 erroger ce que l’on entend par les « acteurs » du discours : que parta
 gent l’acteur social\, et son double en discours\, l’énonciateur et/o
 u le locuteur ? Les acteurs sociaux\, individuels ou collectifs\, se const
 ruisent et sont construits en discours\, tout en cherchant à agir sur le 
 monde par le discours. Se consacrant à des analyses fines des faits langa
 giers\, l’Analyse du Discours a pu avoir tendance à négliger la réali
 té sociologique des acteurs sociaux\, au profit de l’observation d’é
 nonciateurs désincarnés. A l’inverse\, les sciences sociales ont pu é
 tudier la construction de catégories d’acteurs sans nécessairement pre
 ndre en compte la complexité des phénomènes discursifs par lesquels ils
  sont catégorisés en discours. Dans un cadre interdisciplinaire\, ce col
 loque propose donc d’étudier les acteurs sociaux par le prisme fin du d
 iscours\, sans négliger la complexité des enchâssements discursifs et f
 aits langagiers\, et sans non plus réduire l’acteur à un élément con
 textuel des corpus : par le discours les acteurs disent\, agissent\, inter
 agissent\, et\, ce faisant\, contribuent à structurer l’espace social. 
 C’est ainsi la relation entre faits langagiers et mouvement des acteurs 
 sociaux qui sera questionnée dans ce colloque.\n\nAxe 1 : Les sujets du d
 iscours entre liberte et determinations\n\nA partir d’études empiriques
 \, les communications proposées pourront notamment tenter de répondre au
 x interrogations suivantes :\n- Enonciateurs et acteurs : comment articule
 r des analyses discursives fines s’intéressant par exemple à l’entre
 lacs des instances discursives au sein d’énoncés\, sans occulter leurs
  sujets en tant qu’acteurs sociaux\, les dynamiques extralinguistiques 
 à l’œuvre\, et les effets du discours sur les pratiques sociales ?\n- 
 Déterminations et libertés : sans renier l’héritage des premiers temp
 s de l’Analyse du Discours\, comment penser les discours comme à la foi
 s contraints par du déjà-dit et par l’inconscient du sujet\, sans pour
  autant nier la capacité d’agir des acteurs sociaux\, les glissements d
 iscursifs et la dimension potentiellement subversive de la parole ?\n- Gra
 nds corpus et sujets parlants : comment appréhender des « grands corpus 
 » représentatifs de la construction de moments discursifs publics (Moira
 nd 2004) tout en s’intéressant aux individualités qui en sont à l’o
 rigine\, et à la parole des acteurs non légitimes ?\n\nAxe 2 : La config
 uration des acteurs sociaux dans le discours\n\nCet axe encourage\, dans l
 e cadre d’études empiriques\, à penser les concepts\, les outils et le
 s méthodes à mobiliser pour analyser la configuration des acteurs dans l
 es discours principalement médiatiques et politiques. Ces derniers sont 
 également à envisager comme les produits de dynamiques professionnelles 
 et sociales qu'il convient de ne pas mettre de côté. Ces pistes de réfl
 exion non restrictives pourraient s’inscrire dans cet axe thématique :\
 n- Les modalités langagières et discursives de construction et d'institu
 tionnalisation des acteurs sociaux et les négociations dont elles sont l'
 objet.\n- La notion d’ « ethos collectif » (Chabrol 2006) dans le cadr
 e d’une analyse des processus de « visibilité » (Voirol 2005) et de 
 « reconnaissance » (Honneth 2007) des acteurs sociaux.\n- La question de
  la représentation de l’acteur dans le discours en tant qu'elle relève
  d’une « question grammaticale » (Van Leeuwen 2009 : 34).\n\nConféren

DESCRIPTION:Invited Speakers:\n\nMaria Koptjevskaja-Tamm (Stockholm)\nDama
 ris Nübling (Mainz)\n\nWorkshop Description:\n\nResearch on proper names 
 has thus far mainly been concerned with diachronic development\, thereby f
 ocusing on etymological problems and the history of names. In linguistics 
 and the philosophy of language there has also been abundant research on th
 e semantics of proper names and the distinction between proper names and c
 ommon nouns. In contrast\, questions about the morphosyntactic properties 
 of proper names have received comparatively little attention in the litera
 ture. Although there are a few aspects that have been discussed in some de
 tail recently such as\, for instance\, the diachronic development of infle
 ctional marking\, in general many questions remain open or have not even b
 een posed yet. One explanation for this is that proper names do not form a
  homogeneous class with respect to their grammatical status but\, rather\,
  there are quite a number of different simplex and complex morphological a
 nd syntactic constructions being subsumed under this category.\n\nThe work
 shop aims to contribute to filling this gap. More specifically\, we wish t
 o explore the morphosyntax of proper names from two perspectives: on the o
 ne hand\, we want to discuss the morphosyntactic properties of proper name
 s. On the other hand\, we want to focus on complex expressions containing 
 proper names. This includes constructions with prepositional phrases (e.g.
 \, by-phrases) or the genitive\, just as deonymic word formation\, compoun
 ding\, conversion\, and others. For both perspectives\, the central questi
 on is in which way and to which extent proper names deviate from non-propr
 ial expressions and whether it is legitimate - or even necessary - to posi
 t a specific grammar of proper names.\n\nTo this end\, we invite both lang
 uage-specific and cross-linguistic contributions. The primary focus is on 
 synchronic data but a diachronic perspective is also very welcome. Topics 
 to be explored include\, but are not restricted to\, the following:\n\n- W
 hat is the morphosyntactic status of (different kinds) of complex proper n
 ames? What are the implications for grammatical theory?\n- Are there diffe
 rences between different kinds of proper names with regard to their morpho
 syntactic properties?\n- How does the morphosyntactic marking of proper na
 mes differ cross-linguistically?\n- How does deonymic word formation diffe
 r from word formation with the same (or: homonymic) derivational affixes?\
 n- Which patterns of onymic word formation can be observed\, both language
 -specifically and cross-linguistically?\n- Are there competing patterns of
  morphological and syntactic constructions with proper names?\n- Are there
  specific patterns of onymic inflection or tendencies that can be observed
  cross-linguistically?

UID:http://linguistlist.org/issues/26/26-4574.html
DESCRIPTION:This workshop will bring together linguists\, philosophers of 
 language and logicians to discuss the topic of epistemic modality\, as thi
 s may manifest itself both at the level of sentence interpretation and at 
 the level of noun phrase interpretation. Its focus is on how discourse ref
 erents are identified and on what the choice of a particular noun phrase r
 eveals about the epistemic status of the referent it introduces. A growing
  amount of attention has recently been devoted to a certain set of indefin
 ite NPs\, the so called epistemic indefinites - e.g.\, German irgendein (K
 ratzer & Shimoyama 2002\, Aloni & Port 2010)\, Spanish algún (Alonso-Oval
 le & Menéndez-Benito 2013)\, Italian un qualche (Zamparelli 2007\, Chierc
 hia 2013)\, Romanian vreun (Fălăuş 2014). These expressions have been r
 eported to signal that some specified agent does not know who the referent
  of the NP is\, or does not care about identifying it in a precise way. Wh
 ile discussing the contextual conditions licensing the use of epistemic in
 definites\, an important issue has come to the fore: What is the relevant 
 sense of not knowing who? This will be among the key questions addressed i
 n the workshop\, along with other more specific ones.\n\nFor example:\n\nW
 hich semantic properties distinguish epistemic indefinites from other inde
 finites?\nHow do the modal properties of epistemic indefinites interact wi
 th the modality inherent to the sentence interpretation?\nWhich logical sy
 stem for belief and knowledge can best capture the attitudes that accompan
 y the use of epistemic indefinites?\nWhat logical relations provide the be
 st model of the inferential processes underlying the use of modal sentence
 s?

DESCRIPTION:An inherent part of almost all discussions of the differences 
 between inflection and derivation used to be the claim that inflectional m
 orphology is paradigmatic while derivational morphology is not. Parallel t
 o the traditional belief of irregularity and unpredictability of derivatio
 nal morphology and\, by implication\, of the peripheral position of deriva
 tional paradigms\, there are views postulating the paradigmatic nature of 
 word-formation (e.g.\, Dokuli 1962\, van Marle 1985\, Bauer 1997\, Becher 
 2004\, Booij 2008\, Stekauer 2014). Therefore\, the focus of the workshop 
 will be on similarities and differences between inflectional and derivatio
 nal paradigms. However\, papers on any theoretical and empirical aspects o
 f morphological paradigms will also be most welcome.\n\nWorkshop organizer

 \nWorkshop proposal for the 49th SLE meeting\,\nNaples\, August 31 – Sep
 tember 3\, 2016\n\nWorkshop Organizers:\n\nDiana Forker\, University of Ba
 mberg\nLenore A. Grenoble\, University of Chicago\n\nAim and Background:\n
 \nThis workshop aims to bring together researchers working on languages th
 at are in contact with Russian in a variety of different sociolinguistic c
 ontexts.\n\nRussian is one of the largest languages that vastly influences
  other languages. Contact between Russian and other languages is long-stan
 ding and extensive\, with Russian speakers expanding across Eurasia to the
  Pacific coast in the east and to the Baltic Sea in the northwest. The vas
 t geographic and political spread of Russian has meant that its speakers h
 ave been in contact with speakers of languages that differ not only typolo
 gically and genealogically but also demographically\, with some being the 
 so-called small-numbered languages and others major regional languages. Th
 is provides fertile ground for the investigation of contact-induced change
 .\n\nContact with Russian has provided important data for the study of cod
 e switching (e.g. Rusakov 2004)\, mixed languages\, such as Copper Island 
 Aleut (e.g. Golovko & Vakhtin 1990)\, the interaction between code-mixing 
 and mixed languages (such as Golovko 2003\, Pakendorf 2009) and Russian pi
 dgins (e.g. Perexval’skaja 2008)\, to name just a few.\n\nIn this worksh
 op we investigate the linguistic and sociolinguistic interactions between:
 \n\n- Russian and the so-called small-numbered languages\, Russian and lan
 guages in the territory of the Russian Federation\, or Russian and other l
 anguages\n-  differing sociolinguistic settings and the role of these diff
 erences\, with special attention to the question of whether different cont
 act situations lead to different outcomes\n\nTopics and Issues Covered:\n\
 nWe are broadly interested in a wide range of topics\, both linguistic and
  sociolinguistic\, involving contact with Russian in the areas of the Balt
 ics\, the Caucasus\, Central Asia\, and the North (including Siberia and t
 he Far East).  \nThese include:\n\n- Language ecologies / contact situatio
 ns including language attitudes\, use\n- Consequences for all parts of the
  grammar (linguistic features): phonetics and phonology\, lexicon\, morpho
 logy\, syntax\, and semantics\n- Code-switching\n- Mixed languages\n- Lang
 uage shift\n- Language contact without shift\n- Language change \n- The re
 levance of social factors in language shift versus vitality (education\, g
 ender\, age\, mobility\, marriage patterns\, etc.)\n\nReferences:\n\nGolov

DESCRIPTION:IMM17 will center around one main topic\, competition in morph
 ology\, which will also provide the title of the planned selected-papers v
 olume.\n\nIn many cases\, languages offer more than one option for realizi
 ng a certain bundle of features (in inflection) or complex concepts (in wo
 rd formation). The ensuing problems have been treated in terms of competit
 ion or rivalry\, under disparate labels\, including Panini's Principle\, t
 he Elsewhere Condition\, blocking\, pre-emption\, suppletion\, overabundan
 ce\, contamination\, constructional blend\, constraint rankings\, inherita
 nce\, race models\, identification of the 'nearest neighbor' in analogical
  models\, etc. Intimately related topics are productivity and restrictions
  on productivity. By putting these associated phenomena at center stage\, 
 we would like to stimulate the theoretical discussion about this important
  area of morphological research.\n\nBesides this main topic the conference
  will be thematically open in order to serve as a seismograph for diagnosi
 ng tectonic shifts going on in the morphological landscape. At the same ti
 me\, workshops up to a limit of twelve papers are welcome to any topic in 
 morphology\, excluding\, of course\, the main topic.\n\nOrganizing Committ

SUMMARY:The 11th Workshop on the Innovative Use of NLP for Building Educat

DESCRIPTION:The BEA Workshop is a leading venue for NLP innovation for edu
 cational applications. It is one of the largest one-day workshops in the A
 CL community. The workshop's continuous growth illustrates an alignment be
 tween societal need and technology advances. NLP capabilities now support 
 an array of learning domains\, including writing\, speaking\, reading\, sc
 ience\, and mathematics. Within these domains\, the community continues to
  develop and deploy innovative NLP approaches for use in educational setti
 ngs. In the writing and speech domains\, automated writing evaluation (AWE
 ) and speech scoring applications\, respectively\, are commercially deploy
 ed in high-stakes assessment\, and instructional contexts (including Massi
 ve Open Online Courses (MOOCs)\, and K-12 settings). Commercially-deployed
  plagiarism detection in K-12 and higher education settings is also preval
 ent. The current educational and assessment landscape in K-12 and higher e
 ducation fosters a strong interest in technologies that yield analytics to
  support proficiency measures for complex constructs across learning domai
 ns. For writing\, there is a focus innovation that supports writing tasks 
 requiring source use\, argumentative discourse\, and factual content accur
 acy. For speech\, there is an interest in advancing automated scoring to i
 nclude the evaluation of discourse and content features in responses to sp
 oken assessments. General advances in speech technology have promoted a re
 newed interest in spoken dialog and multimodal systems for instruction and
  assessment. The explosive growth of mobile applications for game-based an
 d simulation applications for instruction and assessment is another place 
 where NLP can play a large role.\n\nThe use of NLP in educational applicat
 ions has gained visibility outside of the NLP community. First\, the Hewle
 tt Foundation reached out to public and private sectors and sponsored two 
 competitions: one for automated essay scoring\, and the other for scoring 
 of short response items. The motivation driving these competitions was to 
 engage the larger scientific community in this enterprise. MOOCs are now a
 lso beginning to incorporate AWE systems to manage the thousands of assign
 ments that may be received during a single MOOC course. Learning @ Scale i
 s a relatively new venue for NLP research in education. Another breakthrou
 gh for educational applications within the CL community is the presence of
  a number of shared-task competitions over the last four years - including
  three shared tasks on grammatical error correction alone. In 2014 alone\,
  there were four shared tasks in NLP/Education related areas. Most recentl
 y\, the 2015 ACL-IJCNLP Workshop on Natural Language Processing Techniques
  for Educational Applications workshop had a shared task in Chinese error 
 diagnosis. All of these competitions increased the visibility of\, and int
 erest in\, our field.\n\n

DESCRIPTION:The goal of this workshop is to explore not only associated mo
 tion systems\, but the various strategies attested cross-linguistically to
  associate motion events to non-motion events. Our original interest was l
 imited to associated motion morphemes\; in order to study their discourse 
 use\, we designed a stimulus “A hunting story”\, a wordless story comb
 ining motion and non-motion subevents (Vuillermet and Desnoyers 2013\, ava
 ilable on request). This stimulus turned out to be good to capture the gen
 eral diversity of modes of expression of combinations of (a)motion: it has
  so far been successfully used on/with a half dozen of languages (mostly A
 mazonian with no specific associated motion category)\, and it put forward
  varied strategies for co-expressing motion and non-motion events\, such a
 s SVCs\, clause chaining or coordination. \n\nThe workshop will address th
 e question of how languages deal with the linguistic co­expression of a m
 otion and a non-motion event\, seeking to cover all strategies: lexical\, 
 morphosyntactic\, syntactic constructions\, including multiclausal strateg
 ies (in contrast with the works previously mentioned). The workshop aims a
 t bringing together specialists of typologically diverse languages to disc
 uss the following questions: Do languages use only one strategy\, or more 
 than one\, for the co-expression of motion & non-motion events? Do languag
 es with similar typological profiles display the same strategies? If a lan
 guage has more than one strategy\, what are the reasons for the use of one
  over the other? Intra vs interspeaker variation? Pragmatics? Speech style
  / genre? Syntactic constraints (e.g. co-referential subjects) How grammat
 icalized / conventionalized is the strategy used? Is it used elsewhere in 
 the grammar / in other situations\, i.e. for the co-expression of non-moti
 on events (e.g. serial verbs or clause chaining)?

DESCRIPTION:The workshop's theme is multi-modal cognition with an emphasis
  on the interaction between language and vision. More specifically\, there
  is a central focus on how attentional and visual processes interact with 
 spoken and written language processing. Why are attention and vision cruci
 al to language comprehension? Prominent approaches to language-vision inte
 ractions have focused so far on whether language processing is like sensor
 y processing (the 'embodied cognition approach') or whether cross-linguist
 ic differences lead to permanent restructuring of cognition and perception
  (the 'linguistic relativity approach'). We know\, however surprisingly li
 ttle about the nature\, representations\, and mechanisms of every-day lang
 uage-vision interactions such as when language guides our attention around
  the visual world. Core themes of the workshop are the (non)-intentionalit
 y of language-vision interactions\, the nature of competition\, selective 
 processing\, learning and development which suggest that the investigation
  of language-vision interactions by means of methods such as eye-tracking 
 offers a window into the mechanisms of how high level representations invo
 lved in language and memory interact with visual input. The workshop seeks
  to encourage discussions which advance the field in important ways and le
 ad to close collaborations between the participating researchers.\n\nInvit

DESCRIPTION:Since their introduction in the early 1970s\, vector space mod
 els of  meaning have evolved into a well-established area of research in N
 atural Language Processing (NLP). Their probabilistic nature and ability t
 o exploit the abundance of large-scale resources such as the Web make them
  one of the most useful tools (arguably the most successful (Turney and Pa
 ntel\, 2010)) for modeling what we broadly call meaning in language.  The 
 geometry provided by the angular distance between the vectors has been wid
 ely used as a representative of the degree of similarity of meaning in NLP
 . \n \nAnother field in which vector space models play an important role i
 s physics\, and especially quantum theory. Though seemingly unrelated to l
 anguage\, intriguing connections have recently been uncovered. Some exampl
 es include models of compositionality in distributional semantics (Coecke 
 et al. 2010)\, treatments of logical words in vector space models (Widdows
 \, 2003)\, reasoning about the human mental lexicon in cognitive processes
  (Bruza et al.\, 2009)\, using vectors of queries and documents in informa
 tion retrieval (Van Rijsbergen\, 2004)\, and representing the meaning of w
 ords by density operators (Piedeleu et al.\, 2015). There is also a long-s
 tanding history of vector space models in cognitive science. Theories of c
 ategorization such as those developed by Nosofsky (1986)\;   Smith\, Osher
 son\, Rips\, & Keane\, (1988)\, utilise notions of distance between concep
 ts represented as feature vectors. More recently Gärdenfors (2004) has de
 veloped a model of concepts in which conceptual spaces provide geometric s
 tructures\, and information is represented by points\, vectors and regions
  in vector spaces. \n \nExploiting the common ground provided by the conce
 pt of a vector space\, the workshop aims to bring together researchers wor
 king at the intersection of NLP\, cognitive science\, and physics\, offeri
 ng to them an appropriate forum for presenting their uniquely motivated wo
 rk and ideas. The interplay between these three disciplines will foster th
 eoretically motivated approaches to understanding how meanings of words in
 teract with each other in sentences and discourse\, how diagrammatic reaso
 ning depicts and simplifies this interaction\, how language models are det
 ermined by input from the world\, and how word and sentence meanings inter
 act logically.  \n\nTopics of interest include (but are not restricted to)
 : \n \n- Reasoning in semantic spaces \n- Applications of quantum logic in
  natural language processing \n- Compositionality in semantic spaces and c
 onceptual spaces \n- Links between conceptual spaces and natural language 
 processing \n- Modeling functional words such as prepositions and relative
  pronouns in compositional distributional models of meaning \n- Diagrammat

DESCRIPTION:Emotions are complex categories that combine cognitive\, bodil
 y and socio-cultural dimensions of experience. They represent an area of r
 esearch that integrates linguistic\, psychological\, neurological and anth
 ropological lines of inquiry. Ideally\, their comprehensive description sh
 ould account for as many of these factors as possible.  \n\nWithin linguis
 tics\, the principal theoretical paradigms that have sought to explain the
  structuring of emotions include Cognitive Linguistics and Functional Ling
 uistics. Generally\, theoretical conceptual models are proposed\, their ex
 planatory power is tested through the model’s ability to produce accurat
 e and predictive descriptions. The empirical research has been based upon 
 introspective\, observational and elicited data. \n\nThe goal of this work
 shop is to bring together different cognitive and functional linguistic ap
 proaches to emotion studies that are currently prominent in this field of 
 research. The workshop will open with a lecture by one of the most importa
 nt contributors to linguistic theory on emotions\, which will be followed 
 by three representative empirical studies that employ different approaches
  to observational data. \n\nThe questions addressed in this workshop will 
 focus\, among others\, on the following issues:\n\n- Cross-cultural variat
 ion in emotions\n- Cognitive and contextual factors in emotions\n- Emotion
 s in interaction\n- Figurative language in emotions\n- Multimodal structur
 e of emotions\n- Emotional expression in children\n- Structuring of emotio

DESCRIPTION:The Doktorandenforum precedes the annual DGfS-conference and w
 ill take place for the sixth time in February 2016. It is a workshop on a 
 topic of general interest to all PhD-students of linguistics and the main 
 purpose is to give PhD-students an opportunity to meet. The topic of the n
 ext Doktorandenforum will be „Good Scientific Practice''. The programme 
 will soon be available on the conference website. \n\nGood scientific prac
 tice is a topic of great importance for anyone working in academia! \nWhen
  doing a PhD\, candidates of course know that their work has to meet certa
 in standards (e.g. when planning and running an experiment\, when citing o
 ther researchers' works etc.) and do their best to fulfil them. Some of us
  are part of a team whereas others more or less work by themselves. Both g
 roups might\, however\, face problems they might not have expected when st
 arting their PhD. \n\nEven though most people working in academia do their
  best to fulfil the requirements of good scientific practice this might un
 fortunately not always be the case. Problems may arise at any point in an 
 academic career\; but especially PhD students\, who mostly work with peopl
 e more advanced in their career\, may experience conflicts caused by hiera
 rchical relations. Sometimes difficulties also come up when working closel
 y with your supervisor: the fact that we 'depend' on them might be part of
  it. He or she might ask you to work in a way you do not approve of or the
 y might not be happy with the outcome of your work - but what can you do i
 n that case? What if the results of your experiment simply do not tell the
  story your supervisor wants to hear?\n\nProblems can also come up when pu
 blishing a paper: who has done the major part of the work\, is your superv
 isor entitled to be named as co-author just because he provided you with t
 he facilities to run your experiment etc.? \nIt is the duty of every super
 visor to coach their PhD-students! But who do you talk to when things go w
 rong? What do you do when you have the feeling your supervisor is hardly e
 ver available or does not want to help you? This is tricky because on the 
 one hand you need their help\, on the other hand you do not want to argue 
 with them.\n\nIssues like the ones listed above will be addressed in the w
 orkshop and the aim is to provide you with possible strategies to overcome
  them. Every German university has a so-called ombudsman/woman who is a ne
 utral person and an expert concerning everything that is subsumed under th
 e term 'good scientific practice'. \nWe are happy that our local ombudsman
  Prof. Dr. Maret will share his expertise with us on that matter! \n\nTher
 e will be enough room to discuss the individual topics (and in addition\, 
 your questions as well as possible examples you might be able to provide f
 rom your own experience or that of others around you)! \n\nThe workshop wi
 ll be held in English. Participation is free but you should register in ad
 vance\, as the number of participants is limited! If you want to participa
 te please send an e-mail to the e-mail address below. \n\ndoktorandenforum
 .dgfs2016@uni-konstanz.de\n\nImportant: There will be a little pre-warm-up
  for those of you who already arrive Monday evening. Please let us know if
  you will join us for that when you register for the Doktorandenforum.

SUMMARY:The Crosslinguistic Diversity of Antipassives: Function\, Meaning

DESCRIPTION:The crosslinguistic diversity of antipassives: function\, mean
 ing and structure\n\nThis workshop brings together linguists working withi
 n different theoretical frameworks in order to update our understanding of
  the cross-linguistic diversity of the antipassive and antipassive-like co
 nstructions across the world’s languages. This includes such aspects as 
 morphosyntactic properties of the arguments of the antipassive constructio
 n\, the antipassive verbal markers\, morphosyntactic factors determining t
 he structural realization of antipassives\, as well as the functions these
  constructions perform crosslinguistically. The term antipassive refers to
  a derived detransitivized construction illustrated in (1):\n\n(1) West Gr
 eenlandic (Eskimo-Aleut\; Keenan & Dryer 2007: 359)\n    a.  arna-p       
    niqi-∅       niri-vaa\n        woman-ERG       meat-ABS     eat-IND.3
 SG.3SG\n        ‘The woman ate the meat.’\n    b.  arnaq-∅        ni
 qi-mik      niri-NNig-puq\n        woman-ABS      meat-INS      eat-ANTIP-
 IND.3SG\n        ‘The woman ate meat.’\n\nThe antipassive (1b) is deri
 ved from the transitive predication (1a) by means of the antipassive suffi
 x -NNig. The semantic patient (niqi-∅ ‘meat-ABS’) loses its properti
 es of a core argument. The peripheral status of this argument is indicated
  by the instrumental case -mik and the lack of indexing on the verb in (1b
 ). Additionally\, the antipassive modifies the coding properties of the ag
 ent: it is no longer marked with the ergative case.\n\nThe antipassive con
 struction is often characterized by the following properties (Polinsky 200
 5):\na) the patient-like argument of the transitive predicate has lost som
 e or all of its morphosyntactic properties of a core argument\;\nb) the ag
 ent-like argument acquired some morphosyntactic properties usually associa
 ted with S \nc) the reassignment of semantic roles to syntactic functions 
 is usually indicated on the verb (e.g. by an affix)\n\nUp to now\, the lit
 erature on detransitivizing operations primarily focused on the more famil
 iar passive construction. As a result\, not a single book-length on the an
 tipassive has appeared. Given how much progress has been made recently in 
 the study of linguistic diversity and the increasing accessibility of mode
 rn descriptive grammars\, it is time to update our understanding of the an
 tipassive\, its morphosyntactic properties\, distributional patterns and f
 unctional motivation. The proposed workshop is intended to bring together 
 scholars interested in various aspects of the antipassive construction in 
 individual languages and typological variation of antipassive construction

  the following:\n\n- How did the cognitive underpinnings of animacy evolve
  in our primate ancestors\, and how did this interact with the emergence a
 nd evolution of language?\n- How does the cognitive development of distinc
 tions based on animacy shape and support language acquisition?\n- To what 
 extent should animacy be seen as a linguistic feature independent of contr
 asts related to personhood or prominence\, including definiteness\, indivi
 duation vs collectivity\, specificity\, etc.?\n- Animacy effects related t
 o the human vs non-human contrast are well-attested in human grammars\, bu
 t what sorts of linguistic contrasts do we find based on distinctions at t
 he lower end of the animacy hierarchy?\n- Can generative linguists increas
 e the descriptive adequacy of their models by invoking gradience or other 
 non-binary feature specification in analysing animacy effects?\n- How does
  folkbiological classification of biological animacy in the natural world 
 map onto linguistic animacy hierarchies?\n\nOrganisers: \n\nDiane Nelson\,

SUMMARY:Typology of Uralic Languages: Towards Better Comparability

DTEND;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20160903T000000

DESCRIPTION:Convenors: Gerson Stefan Klumpp (Tartu)\,Lidia Federica Mazzit
 elli (Bremen)\,\nFedor Rozhanskiy (Tartu)\n\nUralic studies have a long es
 tablished tradition that developed on the base of historical linguistics. 
 Many disciplines that play an essential role in contemporary linguistics (
 e.g. phonology and typology) are younger than Uralistics\, and integration
  between the study of Uralic languages and contemporary linguistic discipl
 ines is often not sufficient. Consequently\, Uralic studies have at least 
 two weak sides:\n\n- A lack of contemporary synchronic grammars based on m
 odern linguistic theory that can be used by typologists. An obvious illust
 ration can be found in WALS: most of the referenced Uralic grammars are cr
 ucially outdated.\n- Many grammars of Uralic languages follow the old-styl
 e tradition\, specific for a particular language. The degree of comparabil
 ity between Uralic grammars is very low. In the Finnish tradition the case
  of the direct object is termed ''Accusative''\, in the Estonian tradition
  ''Nominative/genitive.''\n\nThese weak sides have been realized by many r
 esearchers\, and gave rise to new approaches and a recent “renovation”
  of Uralic studies. New contemporary grammars are being published (Winkler
  2001\, Siegl 2013\, Nikolaeva 2014\, Wilbur 201 5). Considerably more att
 ention has been paid to typology\, cf. the volume “Negation in Uralic la
 nguages” (Miestamo\, Tamm & Wagner-Nagy 2015)\, and the  projects “Ura
 lic Essive” (De Groot 2013) and “Oxford Guide to Uralic languages” (
 directed by M. Bakró-Nagy\, J. Laakso & E. Skribnik)\, currently in prog
 ress.\n\nThe current workshop aims at bringing together linguists working 
 on Uralic languages from the position of modern linguistic theory and typo
 logy. The main goal of the workshop is to increase the level of comparabil
 ity of the Uralic languages\, to promote the integration of Uralic studies
  into contemporary linguistics\, to stimulate the dialogue between researc
 hers of Uralic languages working on different language levels.\n\nThe topi
 cs to be addressed include (but are not restricted to) the following:\n\n-
  the sounds of Uralic languages from the point of view of modern phonologi
 cal and prosodic studies\n- phonology-morphology interface in the Uralic l
 anguages\n- revisiting morphological and syntactic categories of the Urali
 c languages\n- new approaches to morphological and morphophonological stud
 ies of the Uralic languages\n- argument structure and DOM/DSM in the Urali
 c languages\n- questions of word order and information structure in the Ur
 alic languages\n\nPreference will be given to papers that compare several 
 Uralic languages or dialects and aim at a uniform description of the data 
 and promote comparability. We also welcome papers addressing a particular 
 language that offer new approaches to data interpretation in light of cont
 emporary linguistics\, as well as papers comparing one or more Uralic lang
 uages with their neighbouring language(s).\n\nReferences\n\nDe Groot\, C.

SUMMARY:Gender and Classifiers: Diachronic and Synchronic Variation
DTSTART;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20160128T000000

DESCRIPTION:Following two previous workshops – 'Gender and Classifiers: 
 Cross-linguistic perspectives' in 2014 and 'Gender and Classifiers: Areal 
 and genealogical perspectives' in 2015 – for our third workshop we want 
 to take a closer look at gender and classifiers from the perspective of bo
 th diachronic and synchronic variation.\n\nGender and classifiers are usua
 lly thought of as two distinct\, yet mutually exclusive\, systems of noun 
 categorisation. In a gender system\, as for example in Italian or German\,
  nouns are assigned one or more genders on a semantic or formal basis\, an
 d the genders of the language can be defined by sets of markers on agreeme
 nt targets. In a classifier system\, as we find it in Chinese or Vietnames
 e for instance\, a noun appears with a semantically compatible classifier 
 in certain contexts\, e.g. quantification with a numeral. But recent resea
 rch has turned up more and more languages (mostly Papuan\, South American\
 , and Australian) in which the two co-occur\, yielding overlapping and int
 eracting systems of classification.\n\nThe role that diachronic and synchr
 onic variation play in languages which exhibit both systems is an exciting
  and new area of enquiry which promises to expand our understanding of the
  relation between the two systems\, particularly in light of the fact that
  they are often involved in processes of grammaticalisation (e.g. gender s
 ystems which develop from classifier systems).\n\nThis workshop is part of
  the research project “Combining Gender and Classifiers in Natural Langu
 age” funded by the AHRC (UK).\n\nDate: 28–29 January 2016\nVenue: Univ
 ersity of Surrey\, Guildford\, United Kingdom\nOrganized by the Surrey Mor
 phology Group\n\nInvited Speaker:\n\nProfessor Maria Polinsky (University 
 of Maryland)\n\nLanguage Tutorial:\n\nAs a special part of this workshop\,
  Professor Gunter Senft (Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics\, Nijm
 egen) has kindly agreed to give a language tutorial on the system of class
 ifiers in Kilivila\, the Austronesian language of the Trobriand Islanders 
 of Papua New Guinea.

 ng on different aspects of the scientific study of language and experts in
  Georgian and South Caucasian (Kartvelian) languages. Its primary goal is 
 to promote a dialogue between scholars from different approaches\, establi
 shed scholars\, as well as graduate students and young scholars at the beg
 inning of their career.\n\nGeorgian and the small language family to which
  it belongs (Laz\, Mingrelian\, Svan) manifest a dazzling array of unusual
  linguistic characteristics and are associated with a strong philological 
 tradition in Georgia itself.  Researchers who do not read Georgian or Russ
 ian may be familiar with some aspects of these languages thanks to the wor
 k of Western scholars like Stephen Anderson\, Alice Harris\, George Hewitt
 \, Alec Marantz\, or Stavros Skopeteas. However\, the languages in the Kar
 tvelian family deserve more attention from scholars\, and could be explore
 d in greater detail by an international team that would bring together spe
 cialists versed in the Georgian linguistic and philological tradition and 
 general linguists working on phonology\, syntax\, language acquisition\, l
 anguage variation\, and sentence processing\, whether they are or not expe
 rts on Kartvelian. This workshop is part of the bilateral effort to create
  closer ties between two research communities\, both invested in the study
  of individual Kartvelian languages or of comparative aspects of Kartvelia
 n languages. \n

DESCRIPTION:Inheritance Hierarchies in Morphology\nUniversität Zürich\nK
 eynotes: Geert Booij (Universiteit Leiden) and Dunstan Brown (University o
 f York)\n\nInheritance hierarchies or inheritance networks are an importan
 t part of a number of contemporary morphological theories\, such as Constr
 uction Morphology (Booij 2010)\,Network Morphology (Brown and Hippisley 20
 12)\, and Word Grammar (Hudson 2006). Such approaches contrast with rule-b
 ased morphological models such as Distributed Morphology (Halle and Marant
 z 1993). Inheritance networks have been invoked to yield new perspectives 
 on long-standing issues in morphology like productivity and regularity (Br
 own forthc.)\, holistic morphological typology (Brown 2010)\, and multi-wo
 rd units (Booij 2010). However\, much remains to be explored concerning th
 e precise nature and architecture of these inheritance hierarchies. For in
 stance\, hierarchies of different types have been proposed (e.g. lexical c
 lass hierarchies\, ontological hierarchies\, syntactic hierarchies\, and m
 orphological hierarchies)\, but it is not clear what the restrictions (if 
 any) on an inventory of hierarchies are or how the different hierarchies r
 elate to or interact with each other.

 Sciences. It will enable participants from various horizons to share knowl
 edge and experience thus providing new perspectives for young researchers 
 in the making.

 nThe LCM Mission Statement (http://languageculturemind.org/)\nHuman natura
 l languages are biologically based\, cognitively motivated\, affectively r
 ich\, socially shared\, grammatically organized symbolic systems. They pro
 vide the principal semiotic means for the complexity and diversity of huma
 n cultural life. As has long been recognized\, no single discipline or met
 hodology is sufficient to capture all the dimensions of this complex and m
 ultifaceted phenomenon\, which lies at the heart of what it is to be human
 . In the recent past\, perception and cognition have been the basis of gen
 eral unifying models of language and language activity. However\, a genuin
 e integrative perspective must also incorporate the intersubjective dimens
 ion of cultural symbols\, cultural norms and cultural practices. LCM confe
 rences articulate and discuss approaches to diverse genres of language act
 ivity which aim to understand their cultural\, social\, cognitive and bodi
 ly foundations. LCM conferences welcome contributions from scholars and sc
 ientists in anthropology\, biology\, linguistics\, philosophy\, psychology
 \, semiotics\, semantics\, discourse analysis\, cognitive and neuroscience
 \, and from other disciplines\, who wish both to impart their insights and
  findings\, and learn from other disciplines.\n\nThe LCM International Org

DESCRIPTION:In this conference\, continuing the exploration of cross-categ
 orial relations between the main lexical classes that was initiated in WAA
 SAP I (University of Greenwich) and WAASAP II (University of Tromsø)\, we
  want to concentrate on the semantic\, morphological and syntactic relatio
 ns between adjectives and verbs and their extended projections. The topics
  we are particularly interested in include:\n\n- The hypothesis that aspec
 t and degree are built using the same restricted set of primitives: relati
 ons between scalarity and Aktionsart (eg.\, Hay\, Kennedy & Levin 1999) an
 d scales' sensitivity to boundednes (Kennedy & McNally 2005). We welcome s
 ubmissions that explore the relationship between the lexical aspect of a v
 erb and the scalar properties of their related participles\; the explorati
 on of degree achievement verbs (such as whiten)\; the exploration of the s
 imilarities and differences between grammatical aspect in the verbal domai
 n and external degree modifiers and comparative structures in adjectives (
 de Vries 2010\, Bochnak 2013)\, among other issues.\n\n- The relation betw
 een mood and modality in adjectives and verbs\; the notion of intensionali
 ty in adjectives\, versus non-intersectivity\, non-subsectivity or privati
 vity and their relation to gradability (Beck 2000\, Partee 2005\, Matushan
 sky 2008\, Constantinescu 2011)\; the relation between modal operators in 
 nominal and verbal domains (Schäfer 2005\, Fleischer 2008)\; the expressi
 on of mirativity or evidentiality through adjectives. \n\n- The morphologi
 cal relations between adjectives and verbs in word formation: classes of v
 erbs derived from adjectives\, beyond degree achievements\; classes of adj
 ectives derived from verbs\, beyond participial formations (Oltra-Massuet 
 2014\, Fábregas 2015)\; the emergence of episodic and non episodic readin
 gs of derived adjectives\; affix rivalry\; relations between adverbs and a
 djectives in word formation.\n\n- The different modification relations of 
 verbs and adjectives. On the assumption that adverbial modification is pro
 totypically verbal\, e.g.\, noun-modifying adverbs and their alternations 
 with adjectives with similar semantics (as in Spanish el anteriormente pre
 sidente\, lit. 'the previosly president')\; the conditions under which syn
 categorematicity is allowed in adjectival modification\, as in frequent fl
 yer (Abusch & Rooth 1997\, Larson 1998\, Zimmermann 2000\, Morzycki 2005\,
  Gehrke & McNally 2010\, Sassoon 2013\, among many others).\n\n- Argument 
 structure asymmetries and relations between adjectives and verbs: do adjec
 tives introduce their subjects of predication? Are thematic relations as r
 estricted in adjectives as it is typically assumed? (Cinque 1990\, Baker 2
 002\, Meltzer-Asscher 2011).\n\n- Agreement asymmetries between adjectives
  and verbs (cf. for instance Baker 2008).\n\nKeynote speakers:\n\nIsabel O

SUMMARY:The Profile of Event Delimitation

DESCRIPTION:Events\, as opposed to states\, are largely accepted as lingui
 stic individuals across theories and frames\, although the ways in which t
 hey are defined and identified in linguistics and in philosophy is still u
 nder debate. In this workshop\, we address the issue of the individuation 
 of events by considering the strategies that are exploited across language
 s for delimiting single occurrences. We propose to use the notion of event
  delimitation as a semantically grounded notion that can serve two purpose
 s. It can contribute to developing a principle of event individuation\, an
 d it offers a working hypothesis for gaining insights on a collection of l
 inguistic expressions and morpho-phono-syntactic devices that may otherwis
 e look motely.\n\nIn the linguistic literature\, the issue of event delimi
 tation has been tackled by studies that appeal to aspectual notions and ha
 s also surfaced\, among others\, in syntactic discussions\, for instance o
 n valence alternation and case marking. A first aspectual notion that is r
 elevant is that of telicity. Several options have been explored in the lit
 erature to characterise the events that are endowed with such a form of de
 limitedness. Telicity has been expressed in temporal terms within the Vend
 lerian tradition\, or by exploiting mereological structures—cf. Bach (19
 86)\, Krifka(1989\, 1998) —or by making reference to the internal struct
 ure of the event—for instance by decomposing events into conceptual comp
 onents\, e.g. Travis (2000)\, Ramchand (2008). In empirical terms\, telici
 ty is a property of a subset of verbal predicates that can be attributed t
 o verbal stems\, as well as to verbs taken together withthe argument struc
 ture lexically or structurally associated with them\, cf. the rich product
 ion focussing on the internal argument and its thematic relation\, and on 
 resultative complements. Another well-established notion relevant for talk
 ing about delimitation is that of perfectivity. Perfectivityis a matter of
  viewpoint projected on the event\, and as such it is independent from the
  intrinsic properties of the event\, strictly speaking. It brings about de
 limitedness by making the endpoint accessible. In empirical terms\, perfec
 tive aspect is mainly expressed by inflexional and derivational morphology
 \, e.g. aspectual prefixes\, and is syntactically represented as the domai
 n of higher aspect. Aspect\, complementation and tense morphemes/adverbs a
 ppear to be extremely important ingredients. The existing wealth of work p
 rovides the empirical and theoretical background on which to rely.\n\n\n

 long time\, linguistic research has been trying to describe the relation b
 etween the different elements of an utterance\, and yet the relation betwe
 en agreement and non-agreement still remains a “riddle” (Jespersen 192
 4).\n\nThe notion of agreement (consequentia)\, which appeared quite late 
 in grammatical tradition (Colombat 1996)\, was used in Latin to designate 
 agreement phenomena per se\, but also complementarity-related phenomena. H
 ence the association found in more recent descriptions between such notion
 s as case agreement\, declension\, tense agreement\, inflection\, to name 
 but a few. Following Lehmann’s work (1982\, 1988) it could be interestin
 g to really think about the impact of the use of those terms on the descri
 ption of the phenomenon at stake. Thoroughly accounting for the different 
 ways in which elements are linked to one another would certainly help us g
 ain greater insight into the way languages work.\n\nStudies on language ty
 pology and universals (Kihm 2005\, Caubet\, Simeone-Senelle et Vanhove 198
 9) have indeed identified the existence of hierarchies and specified agree
 ment patterns for world languages. They have also led to the observation t
 hat this phenomenon goes beyond the frame of morphosyntax (Danon-Boileau\,
  Morel\, Tamba 1996). But how certain can we be that the notion of agreeme
 nt is relevant to all languages (Delplanque 1996)? Slavic languages for in
 stance – where agreement only occurs in certain configurations – raise
  the issue of agreement stability\, which could also be addressed in order
  to put into perspective the investigation of the potential relation betwe
 en agreement and non-agreement.

DESCRIPTION:Benitez-Rojo gives us a graphic description of the Caribbean a
 s ''an 'other' shape that keeps changing\, with some objects born to light
  while others disappear into the womb of darkness.” This brings forth th
 e idea that if we do not change and continue to focus on the cultural and 
 linguistic fragmentation that has arisen from our colonized past\, we run 
 the risk of remaining static.\n\nIt is time to go beyond the effects of co
 lonization and reinterpret our past in order to re-envision our future. Le
 t us embrace the idea of uninhibited unity and form our own futures.

DESCRIPTION:The school is often identified as an important context for the
  revitalization of endangered languages. Curriculum design and evaluation 
 are therefore key factors in ensuring that such educational initiatives ar
 e successful. However\, the precise sociocultural and political situation 
 of endangered languages often preclude the simple replication of a curricu
 lum developed for a language of wider communication for use within the end
 angered language classroom. This conference invites papers that reflect on
  these issues: How should conventions designed for dominant languages be m
 odified in the endangered language context? To what extent should curricul
 um design and evaluation be situated within the social and cultural practi
 ces of the endangered language speech community? How should the short- and
  long-term goals of curriculum design and evaluation be assessed in the co
 ntext of endangered languages? Who is best placed to design and to evaluat
 e the curriculum for endangered languages – the linguist or the communit
 y? Are the goals of an endangered language curriculum simply to obtain flu
 ency or should they be broader in scope? How should the approaches used in
  the design and evaluation of an endangered language curriculum take accou
 nt of contextual factors? What problems arise for curriculum design and ev
 aluation in multidialectal and/or multinational contexts? What pedagogical
  materials are necessary for the successful implementation and evaluation 
 of an endangered language curriculum?

SUMMARY:Paradigmatic Approaches to Word Formation: Where are up to?

DTEND;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20160903T000000
UID:http://linguistlist.org/issues/26/26-4701.html
DESCRIPTION:Among the many trends that shape contemporary morphology\, par
 adigm-based approaches is attracting the interest of a growing number of m
 orphologists. \n\nOver the last decade\, the paradigmatic approach is beco
 ming a standard in inflectional morphology ( Stump 2001\, Ackermann\, Blev
 ins\, Maalouf 2009\, Bearman\, Corbett & Brown 2010\, Stump & Finkel 2013\
 , Bonami & Stump to appear\,). For some years\, following the example give
 n by inflection\, the paradigmatic approach is gaining a growing support i
 n the field of Word Formation (WF)\, essentially derivation. More and more
  work refers to it\, as can be seen by referring to recent handbook articl
 es on the issue (such as Stekauer 2014 or Boyé & Schalchli\, to appear).
  The authors who are interested in the paradigmatic dimension of the deriv
 ation\, or offering derivational paradigmatic models include (without clai
 ming to be exhaustive) Van Marle 1985\, Stump 1991\, Bochner 1993 who intr
 oduces the notion of 'cumulative patterns' and in his wake Strnadová 2015
 \, Bauer 1997\, Booij 1997\, Pounder 2000\, and Hathout 2011\, Roché 2009
 \, 2011\, Roché & Plénat 2014 who define an organization of the lexicon 
 based on derivational families and series.\n\nIn the wake of the word-base
 d models (specifically in connection with the word and paradigm approach i
 ntroduced by Blevins 2013)\, paradigmatic derivation is a response to the 
 generative approach to WF and to the binary and oriented rules advocated i
 n  the generative tradition. \n\nIn other words\, in a paradigmatic perspe
 ctive\, the morphological paradigms are interconnected by more or less com
 plex networks of words\, reflecting the patterns of the many  relations th
 at each word has with the others. For a given word\, these networks cluste
 r into a derivational family. \n\nThere is a good chance that the new way 
 to perceive WF but also the structure of the lexicon\, opened up by the no
 tion of paradigm\, will strongly boost the development of new models and l
 ines of arguments\, be they in descriptive or theoretical WF systems\, in 
 typological approaches to morphology\, in psycholinguistics\, e.g. in lang
 uage acquisition aspects\, in natural language processing or in the framew
 ork of statistical modeling.  \n\nThis workshop gives us the opportunity t
 o point out the recent advances on paradigms in Word Formation and particu
 larly in derivation.\n\nWorkshop Organizers : Nabil Hathout (UMR CLLE-ERSS

DESCRIPTION:This conference\, scheduled to take place during the 2016 Euro
 pean Championship and hosted by the University of Basel’s Department of 
 English\, takes up soccer with a special focus on its poetics and aestheti
 cs. The conference particularly seeks to scrutinize the poetics and aesthe
 tics of the game in light of comparative as well as transnational\, transc
 ontinental\, and global perspectives. In doing so\, it aims to shed light 
 on the poetics and aesthetics of all aspects of soccer\, from the actual g
 ame to fan chants and choreographies\, from representations in the arts to
  the aesthetics of media coverage\, from the poetics of live commentary to
  institutional image cultivation (MLS\, FIFA\, UEFA\, etc.)\, from aspects
  of design (jerseys\, balls) to recent developments in stadium architectur
 e. Given this range and diversity of the forms in which the poetics and ae
 sthetics of soccer manifest themselves\, the conference by necessity is in
 terdisciplinary in nature\, with possible contributions coming from fields
  such as literary and cultural studies\, philosophy\, linguistics\, visual
  studies and the arts\, design\, and architecture to name but a few.\n\nPo
 ssible topics include but are not limited to:\n\n- the poetics and aesthet
 ics of the game\n- “skill\,” “creativity\,” “intuition\,” and 
 “style” in soccer\n- soccer and the notions of the beautiful and the s
 ublime\n- fan chants\n- fan choreographies\n- Ultra aesthetics\n- the aest
 hetics (and politics) of institutional image cultivation via the staging o
 f events such as opening ceremonies\, fixture draws\, player award ceremon
 ies\, etc.\n- languages of/in soccer\n- the poetics and rhetoric of soccer

DESCRIPTION:Mainstream media outlets are often among the most relevant\, i
 nfluential and powerful sources of information. This ranges from the influ
 ence that newspapers have on elections to the damage to a brand’s reputa
 tion that a negative article on a popular blog can cause.\n\nInformation R
 etrieval (IR) applied to news has been a popular research area for decades
  but it would be a mistake to assume that news search has been ‘solved
 ’. Not only can algorithms still be improved but also there are serious 
 gaps in the state of the art that need to be addressed.\n\nIn this worksho
 p\, we will stimulate discussion around new and powerful uses of IR applie
 d to news sources. We invite contributions on any of the multiple IR tasks
  that can help solve real user problems in this area.\n\nTo accompany the 
 workshop\, we have released a new data collection suitable for many resear
 ch projects. This consists of about 1 million recent news articles from a 
 wide range of sources. One goal of the workshop is to define shared challe
 nges using this data\, such as news recommendation\, deduplication\, multi
 ­-document summarization\, event detection and clustering. We encourage s
 ubmissions of applied research that uses this data\, although this is not 
 required.\n\nTopics of Interest\n\nRelevant topics of interest for NewsIR
 ’16 include but are not limited to:\n\n– Integration of traditional an
 d social media\n– Credibility\, readability and controversy\n– Bias an
 d plurality in news\n– News recommendation\n– Temporal aspects of news
 \n– Event and anomaly detection\n– Diversification\n– Summarization 
 of multiple documents\n– Information filtering\n– User­-generated con
 tent (e.g.\, using comments to enhance news retrieval)\n– De­-duplicati
 on and clustering of news articles\n– Author identification and disambig
 uation\n– Evaluation\n– Data visualization\n\nOrganising Committee:\n\

DESCRIPTION:With the participation of leading experts in the field\, the w
 orkshop aims to focus on the theoretical implications of empirical work as
  conducted by CLARe's projects (Corpora for Language and Aging Research)\,
  in order to develop the outlines of future collaboration in this young bu
 t cutting-edge domain of research in linguistics and aging. Although impor
 tant studies on related subjects have been published since the 1940s\, the
  field of studies on language and age and its relationships has remained m
 arginal to date in linguistics. Contrary to the demographic situation of c
 ontemporary societies\, where the older age groups take part in a wide ran
 ge of social activities\, the older people are underrepresented in socioli
 nguistic panels. While in psycholinguistics ‘normal aging’ has turned 
 out to be an important issue\, it still has not obtained the status of ‘
 normal’ issues in linguistic research areas concerned with empirical dat
 a\, as in sociolinguistics\, corpus linguistics\, discourse analysis\, and
  pragmatics. The workshop aims to confront the challenges of situating res
 earch on age-related topics in the broader spectrum of linguistic fields a
 nd to promote interdisciplinary and cross-linguistic exchange. Summarizing
  the results reached so far will help to sharpen the questions of future r
 esearch:\n\n- What are the theoretical assumptions in the different fields
  of linguistics?\n- What are the expectations on data usable in different 
 disciplines?\n- What contributions can we expect from linguistic research 
 to a general theory of aging: selection\, optimization and compensation (F
 reund & Baltes 2002)\, individual and age-specific variation (Labov 1994)\
 , cognitive evolutions (Kemper 2015)\, interaction (Coupland/Coupland 1990
 )?\n- How to make results in language and aging research transferable and 
 useful for healthcare professionals\, caregivers\, relatives\, and the sen
 iors themselves?\n\nThe academic program combines programmatic keynotes\, 
 the presentation of PhD projects\, Data Sessions (speech\, gesture and Sig
 n Language corpus data)\, and Round Tables focusing on the most urgent res
 earch desiderata and the planning of joint future research projects.

 \, Austria\, September 21-24\, 2016\nhttps://exapp2016.univie.ac.at/\n\nLa
 nguage use and its inherent variability are an important part of linguisti
 cs and a subject of study in all its branches. Across these branches\, how
 ever\, approaches and objectives differ\, and various methods of investiga
 tion are employed accordingly. The ExAPP conference series presents an imp
 ortant opportunity to juxtapose\, discuss\, and relate the multitude of cu
 rrent approaches to experimental research on language use and variation.\n
 \nAfter highly successful meetings in Groningen (2010) and Copenhagen (201
 3)\, the third installment of ExAPP will take place at the University of V
 ienna in September of 2016\, calling together international researchers wh
 o employ experimental methods to study the perception and production of la
 nguage variation. Topics for presentation extend to all levels of linguist
 ic systems as well as to any aspect of variation with regard to the percep
 tion and production of language use.

SUMMARY:Rising Intonation in English and Beyond

DTEND;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20160603T000000
UID:http://linguistlist.org/issues/26/26-4811.html
DESCRIPTION:Over the past years\, popular media has become interested in i
 ntonational phenomena such as “high rising terminals” (HRTs) and “up
 talk”. These related phenomena are quite common to varieties of English\
 , but why is this the case? To our knowledge\, few studies have looked acr
 oss English varieties to identify the commonalities or differences in how 
 rises work\, and why they might be so widespread in English. The goal of t
 his session is to bring together scholars working on  HRTs and so-called 
 “uptalk” in varieties of English\, but also scholars working on relate
 d phenomena in other languages. Central topics to be addressed include (bu
 t are not limited to) the cross-linguistic nature of the HRT/uptalk phenom
 enon\, teasing out the difference between rises used for HRT/uptalk versus
  other rises in a language’s intonational grammar\, methods at our dispo
 sal to study the phenomenon\, the pragmatics of HRT/uptalk\, sociolinguist
 ic considerations\, and HRT/uptalk realization in the speech of clinical p
 opulations.

DESCRIPTION:The task of describing and understanding speech communication 
 places certain requirements on the acoustic quality and experimental contr
 ol of speech signals. Despite this inevitable fact\, we know surprisingly 
 little about the social\, environmental\, and task-specific factors that s
 hape speech production\, and particularly speech prosody\, inside and outs
 ide the laboratory. Continuing the INSPECT initiative (i.e. “Innovating 
 Speech Elicitation Techniques”) that was started by Niebuhr\, Michaud\, 
 and colleagues in 2013\, our special session aims at bringing together\, w
 ith a focus on prosody\, papers that can sensitize researchers to the chal
 lenges\, sources of variation\, and possible pitfalls of gathering product
 ion data. Thus\, possible topics include (but are to restricted to) in-dep
 th analyses or comparisons of elicitation tasks (including types of readin
 g material)\, prosodic convergence\, the issue of generalization of lab-sp
 eech findings\, reliability of measurements\, individual speaker differenc
 es (e.g.\, with respect to expressive speech\, fluency\, laughter\, breath
 ing)\, effects and artifacts of recording conditions\, such as type of mic
 rophone\, eye contact\, or task duration (fatigue or order/repetition effe
 cts).

DESCRIPTION:In this session\, we explore the notion of new and creative wa
 ys people are using\, speaking and engaging with the Celtic languages in t
 he twenty-first century. As with other language users\, speakers of Welsh\
 , Irish\, Manx\, Cornish\, Breton and Gaelic can engage with a language or
  languages which are not their “mother tongue”\, “native”\, “fir
 st” or “family” languages. In the field of linguistics and its relat
 ed strands\, the “new speaker” category is one which has been examined
  under the perhaps more familiar\, but now increasingly contested labels s
 uch as “non-native”\, “second-language”\, “L2” speaker\, “le
 arner” etc. Similar to related notions such as “emergent bilinguals”
  (García and Kleifgen 2010)\, “multilingual subjects” (Kramsch 2012)\
 , “metrolingualism” (Pennycook 2010)\, “translanguaging” (Creese a
 nd Blackledge 2010) and “translingual practice” (Canagarajah 2013)\, t
 he term “new speaker” and “new speakerness” constitute an explicit
  attempt to move away from these older labels in order to express an incre
 asingly important stage in language attrition and revitalization. As Celti
 c languages\, like other minority languages\, are transformed from communi
 ty into network languages\, the changes which occur at linguistic and soci
 olinguistic levels are important to document in order to add to our unders
 tanding of the processes of language revitalization.

  Conference Center in Gainesville.\n\nThe conference focuses on the compre
 hension\, production\, and acquisition of language at the sentence level\,
  traditionally drawing researchers from linguistics\, cognitive science\, 
 computer science\, education\, neuroscience\, and philosophy. The theme of
  the special session is ''Language Variation Within and Across Speakers''.
  Language variation is a challenge for language acquisition and processing
  models. How do listeners/readers realize that different utterances are di
 fferent ways of saying the same thing\, rather than different things? How 
 do speakers/listeners determine which option is more appropriate or releva
 nt given the context and whom they are talking to? The aim of the special 
 session of the 2016 CUNY conference is to increase awareness regarding lan
 guage variation in general\, and its importance for psycholinguistic resea
 rch more specifically\, by giving an overview of the state-of-the-art rese
 arch on language variation\, particularly in bilinguals.\n\nInvited Speake

DESCRIPTION:''Light verb constructions as complex verbs. Features\, typolo
 gy and function''\n\n(For the complete description of the workshop and pos
 sible topics see the following link: http://www.filcospe.it/images/Complex
 _verbs_Workshop_Proposal.pdf)\n\nAim:\n\nThis workshop aims at addressing 
 the topic of light verb constructions (LVCs) as monoclausal complex predic
 ates. In particular\, we encourage submissions discussing different degree
 s of cohesion\, verb lightness\, noun predicativeness and referentiality i
 n LVCs.\n\n\nDescription:\n\nComplex verbs (CVs) are analytical predicates
  composed of more than one linguistic item\, each of which contributes a n
 on-trivial part of the semantic information associated to a complex predic
 ate (Alsina et al. 1997). Among other possible structures\, we will take i
 nto account light verbs (LVs) as CVs (Butt 2010).\n\nLVCs are structures c
 omposed of a predicative noun and a semantically bleached verb (cf. e.g. t
 o take a walk)\, traditionally called light verb (Jespersen 1965). They ar
 e analytical predicates corresponding to synthetic verbs.\nLVs are usually
  considered as having high generality of meaning\, polysemy\, and the only
  function of codifying grammatical features\, such as TAM features and per
 son (G. Gross\, 2004)\; for this reason M. Gross (1981) defines them as ve
 rbes supports. On the other hand\, the noun of LVCs is usually considered 
 as semantically full\, as well as the nucleus of the predication (De Migue
 l\, 2006). \n\nHowever\, we can assume that the verb is not always semanti
 cally empty. For instance\, basic LVs (e.g. to make\, in to make a war) ha
 ve been distinguished from LVs coding either an aspectual feature (e.g. in
 choative\, as in to take charge) or a diathetic one (e.g. passive\, as is 
 the case of to take advice vs. to give advice) (Gross 2004). Moreover\, ba
 sic LVs can impose selectional restrictions (cf. e.g. Grimshaw & Mester\, 
 1988)\, and can have a partially unspecified argument structure (cf. Di Sc
 iullo & Rosen\, 1990). This means that they can affect both the event and 
 the argument structure.\n\nOn the other hand\, nouns can have different de
 grees of predicativeness. For instance\, in to have a cold\, the predicati
 on of a temporary physiological state is due both to the stative verb and 
 the semantics of the noun\, which denotes a non-permanent physiological st
 ate. In such an instance\, there is a high degree of morpho-syntactic cohe
 sion (Simone 2007) between the two members of the LVCs\, as is shown by th
 e impossibility of syntactic operations such as passivization and object e
 xtraction.\n\nDue to the high degree of morpho-syntactic cohesion in some 
 types of LVCs\, syntactic incorporation has sometimes been called upon. Fo
 r instance\, Baños (2012) speaks of syntactic incorporation for the Latin
  light verb ludos facere ‘to make fun (of somebody)’\, and takes into 
 account the differences between the light verb bellum gero ‘to make a wa
 r’ and the compound belligero ‘to make a war’\, which is a sort of m
 orphological incorporation stored in the lexicon.\nBesides LVs occurring w
 ith a predicative noun\, there are other patterns\, which have been less s
 tudied\, such as [V+PP] (e.g. to take into account\, to have in mind)\, [V
 +Adv] (e.g. to get well)\, [V+Adj] (e.g. to get fat\, to make available)\,
  and [V+V] (e.g. to put to use). Although they occur less frequently than 
 the construction with a noun\, they show similar shifts in cohesion\, whic
 h are bound to change in constituency patterns\, argument and event struct
 ure.\n\nConvenors:\n\nRaffaele Simone\, Lunella Mereu\, Anna Pompei\, Vale

 e Approaches to Language Acquisition - North America (GALANA 7) will take 
 place at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign on September 8-10\
 , 2016. \n\nThe GALANA conference features theoretically informed research
  on all types of language acquisition scenarios\, including (but not limit
 ed to) monolingual first language acquisition\, bilingual/multilingual fir
 st language acquisition\, second language acquisition by children as well 
 as adults\, third language acquisition\, acquisition of signed as well as 
 spoken languages\, language disorders\, language acquisition in the presen
 ce of cognitive impairment and autism\, and the development of pidgins and
  creoles. GALANA-7 will include a special session on ''Input Variation and
  Language Acquisition.''\n\nThe invited speakers for the main session are 
 Cynthia Fisher (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign)\, Roumyana Sla
 bakova (University of Southampton)\, and Virginia Valian (Hunter College a

DESCRIPTION:In some languages the possessor which remains internal to the 
 possessive construction has a greater deal of syntactic ‘prominence’ t
 han typically encountered. Contrary to what is usually expected\, the gram
 matical properties of the possessor (and not the possessed item) are relev
 ant for syntactic processes such as agreement with the verb\, even though 
 both possessor and possessed are part of the same syntactic phrase. A simi
 lar effect can be found with switch-reference\, a special type of marking 
 indicating that the subjects of the two clauses refer to the same entity. 
 Switch-reference typically targets the head of the possessive phrase\, but
  in some languages switch-reference marking indicates that the possessor w
 ithin the subject phrase of one clause is interpreted as referring to the 
 same entity as the subject of the second clause.\n\nThis type of data pres
 ents linguistic theorists with a challenge because\, despite attested vari
 ability across languages in this respect\, models of syntax have little to
  say about it. They have hitherto assumed that agreement and switch-refere
 nce are mechanisms that target the head of the possessive phrase\, but not
  a dependent element.\n\nThe workshop will bring together researchers who 
 are interested in the syntactic effects of internal possessor prominence.\

 s études variationnelles dans la tradition de Flydal et Coseriu\, l’app

 s appel à un inventaire \nterminologique de base (par ex. variété\, dia

 erested researchers from other areas are cordially invited to join the 17t
 h Workshop on the Roots of Pragmasemantics to be held on the top of the Sz
 renica mountain in the Giant Mountains on the border of Poland and the Cze
 ch Republic on March 4-7\, 2016.\n\nThe main theme of this year’s conven
 tion is “Conceptual Semantics meets Compositional Semantics.'' This them
 e builds on recent efforts to build a dialogue between the disparate domai
 ns of Conceptual Semantics\, concerned with meaning as a relation between 
 language and the mind\, often focusing on the level of lexical meaning\, a
 nd Compositional Semantics\, which understands meaning as a relation betwe
 en language and the external reality in terms of reference and a model of 
 composition. Contributions are encouraged from both fields as well as work
  trying to connect the two domains.\n\nConfirmed invited speakers are:\n\n
 - Simon Dobnik (University of Gothenburg)\n- Lotte Hogeweg (University of 
 Amsterdam)\n- Louise McNally (Universitat Pompeu Fabra)\n- Galit Sassoon (
 Bar-Ilan University)\n- Joost Zwarts (Utrecht University)

 ng an ‘intercultural dimension’ in the internationalisation of teachin
 g\, \nlearning and research\n\nCLIE-2016 aims at investigating the intrins
 ic relationship between language and culture \nand the multifariousness of
  their interrelatedness\, in particular from a pragma-semantic \napproach.
  The two-way interdependence and synergies between language and culture ar
 e \ndeterminants of the extent to which culture is included in meaning cre
 ation\, influencing the \nspeakers’ perceptions of culture as reflected 
 in our exchanges about the world surrounding \nus. By delving into the sem
 antics of a language we may reach an understanding of cultural \nmeanings.
  Along the same lines\, this could reveal the implicit suppositions which 
 are \nconnected to them and which are implicitly understood and shared by 
 the community \nmembers\, \nbut not accessible to outsiders.\n\nConference
  topics:\n\n- Discourse Analysis\, Rhetoric and Pragmatics\n- Second Langu
 age Acquisition\n- Semantics and Stylistics\n- Contrastive Linguistics\n- 
 Foreign/Second Language Teaching and Teacher Education\n- Sociolinguistics
 \n- Translating\, Interpreting and Mediation\n- Business Communication\n- 
 Intercultural Communication\n\nOther topics may include more specialised i
 ssues:\n\n- the importance of languages in integrating an international an
 d intercultural dimension in \nthe design and content of university curric
 ula\, as well as in the teaching/learning processes\n- the role and status
  of translation and the translator/transcommunicator in nowadays \nglobali
 sed and technologised societies and cultures\n- the influence of language 
 contact on shaping social\, political\, economic and cultural \ndiscourses
  and identities\, etc.

DESCRIPTION:The concept of the World Conference “DiaIogue Among Civilisa
 tions” refers to the idea developed by the Institute of Political Studie
 s\, Polish Academy of Science\, Warsaw\, following the proclamation of the
  General Assembly of the United Nations from November 1998\, under which t
 he year 2001 was named the “United Nations Year of Dialogue among Civili
 zations”.\n\nWe are deeply convinced that reviving the idea will create 
 a unique opportunity for academics\, social and cultural activists as well
  as politicians to exchange information\, views and ideas\, and the World 
 Conference “Dialogue among Civilisations” will become a platform for c
 onstructive discussions\, leading also to substantial and effective action
 s.\n\n“Dialogue among Civilisations” is planned as a biannual event\, 
 gathering Participants from all over the world. The main focus of this ser
 ies of conference meetings is placed on the complex relations between the 
 EU\, Asia\, Africa and the Middle East observed and discussed on multidire
 ctional level\, as well as the multilateral relations between the Asian\, 
 African and Middle Eastern states.\n\nThe “Dialogue Among Civilisations
 ” World Conference is aimed to:\n\n- Enhance understanding\, tolerance a
 nd respect for different cultures within and among civilizations\n- Sugges
 t effective actions for the future and creating new instruments of inter-c
 ivilisational dialogue\n- Support a new type of economic activities\, whic
 h will allow a parallel and complementary stream to globalisation\n- Prote
 ct and enhance cultural diversity\n\nSeries 1 of the World Conference “D
 ialogue Among Civilisations”\, titled “Dialogue among Civilisations an
 d the (Post)Colonial Legacy”\, organized by the Institute of the Middle 
 and Far East\, Jagiellonian University in Krakow\, Poland\, on 7-9 Septemb
 er 2016\, will be a significant event which will offer a unique opportunit
 y to discuss the past and present of the dialogue between civilisations an
 d cultures and to bring new perspectives and approaches in intercultural u
 nderstanding.

DESCRIPTION:RaAM is committed to the study of metaphor\, metonymy and othe
 r forms of figurative expression in all domains of life and with a particu
 lar focus on the application of \nmetaphor research to real-life issues. W
 ith the 2016 theme “Metaphor in the Arts\, in Media and Communication”
 \, the conference RaAM 11 will embrace this central \nthought by putting t
 he spotlight on ways of metaphorical communication – often beyond the sc
 ope of solely language-based discourse – in some of the most \nprominent
  areas of metaphor usage. RaAM 11 wants to provide a platform for research
  from various fields that regard metaphor as a fundamental principle of \n
 communication in the realm of the arts as well as in different forms of me
 dia and every-day communication. The conference aims to explore metaphor a
 nd metaphor \nusage in contexts that operate on a broad range of sensory d
 ata and different  levels of imagery. This includes film and other audio-v
 isual media\, literature\, poetry\, architecture\, theatre\, painting\, mu
 sic and dance as well as production design\, social media and face-to-face
  communication. We especially invite contributions that \nexplore and disc
 uss the link between these realms: a particular experiential\, embodied\, 
 sensory dimension of metaphor that grounds understanding and the \nemergen
 ce of meaning.\n\nThe conference will feature plenary lectures by:\n\n- Je
 nnifer M. Barker – Georgia State University \n- Petra Gehring – Techni
 sche Universität Darmstadt \n- José Mario Gutierrez Marquez – Bauhaus-

SUMMARY:Towards a Typology of Olfactory Expressions
DTSTART;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20160831T000000
DTEND;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20160903T000000
UID:http://linguistlist.org/issues/26/26-4987.html
DESCRIPTION:Cultural contexts and social environments often determine the 
 vocabulary as well as the \ndevelopment of particular morpho-syntactic pat
 terns leading to a linguistic variation and \ndiversity across languages. 
 A heterogeneous realization of a single linguistic category can \nalso be 
 observed with respect to the linguistic encoding of olfaction\, which we w
 ould like to \nfocus on in this workshop. The received wisdom has it that 
 the terminology of olfactory \nexpressions is generally poorly developed i
 n Indo-European languages (cf. Cain 1979\, \nLawless & Engen 1977\, Engen 
 1987\, Majid & Burenhult 2014\, Wnuk & Majid 2014\, among \nmany others). 
 Recent typological research\, in turn\, shows that a much richer vocabular
 y \nand morpho-syntactic templates describing various odors exist in Non-I
 ndo-European \nlanguages\, cf. Burenhult & Majid (2011)\, Majid & Burenhul
 t (2014)\, Tufvesson (2011) for \nAslian languages\, Lee (2010\, 2015) for
  Formosan languages\, Blench & Longtau (1995)\, \nHombert (1992)\, Van Bee
 k (1992) for different languages spoken in Africa\, to name but a \nfew. I
 n the recent two decades\, comparative approaches to odor terms identifica
 tion and \ncategorization have gained more attention\, as well\, cf. e.g. 
 Ayabe-Kanamura et al. (1998) \nfor Japanese and German\, Ibarretxe (1997) 
 for Basque\, English and Spanish or Staniewski \n(2013) for German and Pol
 ish. However\, despite the increasing number of descriptive and \ncomparat
 ive works a typological account of odor terms unifying their linguistic di
 versity is \nstill missing. In this connection\, we would like to address 
 the question of whether it is \npossible to approach odor expressions acro
 ss various languages and language families in \na unified way\, i.e. takin
 g an approach applicable to all languages\, and how we can account \nfor t
 heir distributional properties by using a parametric model. The main objec
 tive of this \nworkshop is to promote the discussion on olfactory expressi
 ons across (typologically \n(un)related) languages and\, simultaneously\, 
 to figure out to what extent the linguistic \ndiversity of odors can be br
 ought down to a common typological denominator. The \ndiscussion is expect
 ed to provide new insights into how olfactory language systems work in \ng
 eneral and to what extent they are determined by culture-specific factors.

 style’ in Greek and Latin in theoretical and \npractical terms from the 
 perspective of language use and communication—an approach \nthat profits

 search project: \n''Schizophrenia'': Reception\, semantic shift\, and crit

 ic Hospital Zurich University. www.schizophrenie.uzh.ch. \n\nPsychiatry is
  situated at the interface between the natural sciences\, the social scien
 ces \nand the humanities. The ensuing hybrid nature invites inter- and tra
 nsdisciplinary research \napproaches. This conference aims to give a platf
 orm to such approaches asking the central \nquestion: Who or what is\, bec
 omes or constitutes psychiatry's object? \n\nTaking its starting point fro
 m the study of concrete research objects - case notes\, images\, \nfilms a
 nd texts\, diagnostic concepts and labels\, research instruments and thera
 peutic \nprocedures\, doctors and patients - it invites reflection on how 
 objects are related to \nsubjects\, selves and personhood. Can this relati
 onship be conceptualized along the lines of \nthe traditional Western dich
 otomy between object and subject or does it have to be \nfundamentally re-
 thought? And is it linked to other classical dichotomies e.g. the one \nbe
 tween matter and meaning? Is there a role for agents as object-\, subject-
 \, \nself- or thing-makers?\n\nOBJECTS OF PSYCHIATRY takes up current deba
 tes within psychiatry namely the debate \nabout the reification of psychia
 tric diagnoses like ''schizophrenia''\, but also deliberations \nabout aut
 onomy\, human rights and participation. At the same time\, it considers ho
 w the \nhumanities situate psychiatric objects in wider societal contexts 
 and discourses and bring \ninto focus their historical genesis and configu
 ration.\n\nConfirmed keynote speakers: Peter Galison (Harvard University)\

  as new environments of communication – which in turn developed new ways
  of communicating and influenced language. At the same time\, processes th

DESCRIPTION:Afrikaans is unique among the Germanic languages in several wa
 ys: Notably\, it is the only language of the Germanic family that originat
 ed outside of Europe and that is spoken primarily in Africa. Due to the un
 ique historical context in which Afrikaans developed\, it has grammatical 
 features setting it apart from the rest of the Germanic family. Afrikaans 
 is also the first language of over seven million people and the third larg
 est language in South Africa.\n\nIn spite of its uniqueness and the size o
 f the Afrikaans speech community\, Afrikaans is relatively understudied an
 d underdescribed from the perspective of theoretical linguistics. This wor
 kshop seeks to address the paucity of descriptive and theoretical studies 
 of Afrikaans in contemporary linguistics by bringing together scholars who
  work on any aspect of Afrikaans grammar for a two day workshop.

DESCRIPTION:The third (In)Coherence of discourse workshop will be held in 
 the University of Lorraine on December 3-4\, 2015. The objective of the wo
 rkshop is to discuss the latest advances in the modelling of discourses\, 
 in particular the kind held with pathological patients (e.g. schizophrenic
 s). The adopted modelling paradigm is that of formal semantics\, which fal
 ls within the scope of both linguistics\nand logic while also making ties 
 to the philosophy of language.\n\nTopics of interest include (but are not 
 limited to):\n\n- Discourse comprehension and representation\n- Experiment
 al studies of non standard dialogues\n- Formal accounts of dialogues\n- Lo
 gic and reasoning\n- Semantics / Pragmatics interfaces\n- Goals\, intentio
 ns and commitments in dialogues\n- Cognitive Psychology\n- Psycholinguisti
 cs\n- Mental illness and cognitive (in)coherence\n- Radical interpretation
 \n- Logicality and cognitive (in)coherence\n\nLike the previous (In)Cohere
 nce of discourse workshops\, the third edition is organised by the SLAM (S
 chizophrenia and Language: Analysis and Modelling) project. The SLAM proje
 ct aims to systematize the study of pathological conversations as part of 
 an interdisciplinary approach combining Psychology\, Linguistics\, Compute
 r Science and Philosophy. It focuses particularly on conversations involvi
 ng people with psychiatric disorders (schizophrenia\, bipolar disorder).\n

DESCRIPTION:4th Undergraduate Conference on ELT\, Lingustics\, and Literat
 ure 2016 is organized by English Language Education Study Program of Sanat
 a Dharma University. This event is an undergraduate conference. We welcome
  abstracts and full papers from all undergraduate students.\n\nIn this glo
 balization era\, which is  significant for development in every aspect of 
 life\, people are faced to the challenges in fulfilling their needs. To ac
 hieve it\, they are required to communicate and make some relations with o
 ther people. As a consequence\, mastering a language becomes their need to
  develop themselves. Therefore\, language is important as the information 
 and communication tool.  \n\nSome languages are considered as an internati
 onal language in this globalization era to bring  information and communic
 ation around the world. One of those international languages is  English. 
 In Indonesia\, English plays an important role. Regardless of age\, social
  status\, religion\, or gender\, people learn English. For  example\, in a
  public area\, we can easily find banners\, brochures\, or announcements w
 ritten in English.\n\nHaving observed the importance of English in Indones
 ia\, English Language Education Study Program of Sanata Dharma University 
 have held The First Undergraduate Conference on ELT\, Linguistics\, and Li
 terature in 2013 and The Second Undergraduate Conference on ELT\, Linguist
 ics\, and Literature in\, 2014. From the participants’ enthusiasm and th
 e participation\, this seminar was considered a success. As the action of 
 improvement\, English Language Education Study Program of Sanata Dharma Un
 iversity will hold The Third Undergraduate Conference on ELT\, Linguistics
 \, and Literature on June 13\, 2015. This program is important in order to
  provide opportunities for undergraduate students to develop their English
   knowledge and skills. Besides that\, they are given the chance to share 
 their ideas\, opinions\, and thoughts in relation to language.\n\nPrincipa
 lly\, there are three major fields which will be accommodated in this conf
 erence: English Language Teaching (ELT)\, linguistics\, and literature. Di
 scussing ELT\, undergraduate students can\, for example\, talk about the i
 nfluence of English on education such as teaching English inside or outsid
 e class\, designing appropriate materials\, or managing classroom. Meanwhi
 le\, in linguistics\, they can bring up\, for instance\, English phonology
 \, English morphology\, English pragmatics as the topics. Last but not lea
 st\,  discussing literature enables undergraduate students to investigate 
 the role of English towards Indonesian literary works and other related to
 pics.

SUMMARY:Events in Language and Cognition

DESCRIPTION:Understanding how speakers wrap event conceptualizations into 
 linguistic descriptions is crucial for both linguistic theory and psycholo
 gy. A number of rich linguistic theories have been proposed to account for
  the observed ways in how meaning maps to syntax within and across languag
 es\, but their psychological status remains unclear. These theories often 
 propose specific representational architecture\, ranging from prototype th
 eories to predicate decomposition. How are these conceptual models and map
 pings grounded in non-linguistic cognition? On the side of cognitive scien
 ce\, our understanding of event representation\, especially in infancy\, h
 as advanced dramatically in the past several decades\, potentially opening
  up new possibilities for evaluating the plausibility of proposed argument
  structure theories. What can the understanding of event perception and co
 gnition teach us about the nature of semantic representations for language
 \, and how can psycholinguistic evidence contribute to research on event s
 tructure? \n\nWe aim to bring together psycholinguists interested in how l
 anguage maps onto event structure\, adding momentum to a growing field of 
 interdisciplinary scholarship of event representation in linguistics\, psy
 cholinguistics\, and cognitive science. We define three broad questions of
  interest:\n\n(1) How do children and adults mentally represent events at 
 the level of abstraction that is encoded in language? \n\n(2) How is the s
 tructure of events represented in and conveyed by language?\n\n(3) How to 
 the constraints of the infant cognitive system and questions of learnabili
 ty constrain our theories of language – and how does language constrain 
 our theories of the infant cognitive system?  \n\nSeveral fields are curre
 ntly approaching each of these questions\, though with different theoretic
 al underpinnings\, methods\, and terminologies. Given that\, what should w
 e be working on as an interdisciplinary field? Are there specific empirica
 l questions that would be relevant to all theoretical perspectives? And wh
 at is necessary in order to bring together psycholinguists working on diff
 erent questions? \n\nIn this workshop\, we want to both foster an exchange
  of recent work\, and set a possible agenda for psycholinguistic research 
 on event structure as conveyed by language.\n\nConfirmed Invited Speakers:

SUMMARY:28th Annual North American Conference on Chinese Linguistics

DESCRIPTION:The 28th annual North American Conference on Chinese Linguisti
 cs (NACCL–28) organized by Brigham Young University will be held at the 
 Provo Marriott Hotel and Conference Center from May 6 to May 7 in Provo\, 
 Utah. \n\nThe theme of the conference will be Language Diversity and Langu
 age Variation. There is a long tradition of examining and documenting the 
 myriad varieties of the Chinese language. However\, until more recent deca
 des\, most of the work on variation has been in the form of traditional di
 alectology and–––to a lesser extent––through the lens of languag
 e policy. In addition to policy and dialect studies\, there is now a subst
 antial literature in the sociolinguistics of Chinese\, including work on l
 anguage contact\, multilingualism\, and other related disciplines. By its 
 nature the study of variation interfaces with all the major linguistic sub
 -disciplines (e.g.\, phonology\, morphology\, syntax\, pragmatics\, and le
 xicography) and variation can be approached in many ways\, including throu
 gh traditional fieldwork and through natural language corpora. Moreover\, 
 understanding the nature of variation also impacts how Chinese is taught a
 s a second language\, particularly at the higher levels.  Specifically\, t
 he existence of variation in everyday language raises questions about how 
 teachers of Chinese mediate standard language in the classroom and how muc
 h they expose students to non-standard language in preparing them for inte
 raction in the broad Chinese-speaking world.

DESCRIPTION:In the last decade the relations between language\, action\, a
 nd cognition have been investigated from a wide range of perspectives\, in
 cluding semantics\, neurosciences\, \npsychology\, philosophy\, computatio
 nal linguistics\, and robotics.\n\nAs a matter of fact\, action verbs bear
  the basic information that should be understood in order to make sense of
  everyday sentences\, but their lexical encoding remarkably differ \nfrom 
 language to language. For this reason\, both the semantic disambiguation a
 nd the mutual translation of action verbs in natural languages are problem
 atic.\n\nIn language acquisition (and specifically for sign languages\, wh
 ich rely on a visual-gestural modality) the link between the conceptualiza
 tion of actions and their physical \nperformance through the body become c
 rucial\, since gestures anticipate linguistic behaviors in the early stage
 s of child development.\n\nFrom another point of view\, the processing of 
 action related sentences involves the activation of the motor system in th
 e brain\, leading to an embodied representations of the \nthe linguistic m
 eaning. More in general\, neuroscientists investigated the systems which u
 nderlie both language and sensorimotor faculties\, and developed models in
  which \nlinguistic\, cognitive and motor abilities strictly interact.\n\n
 Researches on recognition\, categorization\, and execution of actions have
  also been exploited in the field of robotics\, in order to conceive artif
 icial systems that can understand \ninstructions and perform actions in ac
 cordance to a human-centered model. These researches have been often carri
 ed out in connection to computer vision tasks\, which turn \nout to be ess
 ential for action recognition and for anchoring words (referring to the ob
 jects implied in the actions) to the real word entities.\n\nIn recent year
 s\, several important European projects and initiatives have been develope
 d in order explore the connections among actions\, cognition\, and linguis
 tic abilities\, with \na particular attention to robotics and automatic sy
 stems (Poeticon++\, Robot-Era\, THE Hand Embodied\, ACat).\n\nAmong them\,
  the MODELACT Project (based on the IMAGACT linguistic ontology of action)
  aims to identify how cognitive and linguistic action categories are defin
 ed in \nhumans\, and to develop models that can be used to take account of
  these facts. The project board promotes the MODELACT Conference on ''Acti
 on\, Language and Cognition'' \n(to be held in Rome on 6-7 June 2016)\, wh
 ich intends to represent a meeting point for the widening community that i
 s concerned with the above-mentioned research topics and \nfields.\n\nOrga

  Language Classroom\n\nOver the past several decades\, the foreign languag
 e classroom has increasingly become understood as a site for learners to e
 xplore a diverse range of cultural \ntopics that enable them to become cul
 turally proficient and literate users of the target language. Popular cult
 ure plays a central role in current college curricula\, from \ndiscussions
  of film\, digital literacy\, and national comedy traditions\, to cuisine\
 , sports\, and hip-hop. While pop-culture is widely accepted as central to
  the development \nof transcultural literacy in another language\, there a
 re shifting and expanding approaches to its application in the classroom. 
 Professional organizations such as \nACTFL and the MLA have proposed conte
 nt-based instructional approaches that encourage the integration of cultur
 al artifacts—together with their related practices \nand perspectives—
 into the teaching of foreign languages at all levels of the curriculum. Th
 is conference focuses on approaches to implementing postwar pop-culture \n
 into integrated language/culture instruction in Germanic languages. The De

 submissions \nfrom all areas of Germanic Studies (linguistics\, literature
 \, cultural studies\, and second language studies) to share original contr

 inguistics beyond language − Language beyond linguistics\n \nContemporar
 y linguistic research is often done in close collaboration with other scie
 ntific disciplines. Additionally\, linguistic research is often itself mul
 tidisciplinary by nature\, \nreaching out to cognitive sciences\, educatio
 nal sciences\, sociology\, medicine and technical sciences\, to name but a
  few.\n \nWhen reaching out to educational sciences and language education
 \, linguists investigate how and when languages are learnt and taught. Con
 sequently\, research focuses for \nexample on the methods and technologies
  used in language teaching\, as well as on learning environments and langu
 age learning as a cognitive process.\n \nRecently\, linguists have also be
 come more and more interested in the multilingual world we live in. In mul
 tilingual interactions\, languages come across other languages\, \ntouchin
 g and crossing language boundaries. When exploring these phenomena\, lingu
 ists study the encounters of linguistic resources between different langua
 ges in \nlanguage learning\, everyday and institutional interactions\, tex
 ts\, and in translations.\n \nMoreover\, new links between linguistics and
  other disciplines have resulted in new questions concerning the fundament
 al nature of language. One new area concerns the \nmultimodal features of 
 language use. For example\, linguists have become interested in the link b
 etween gestures – and the body more generally – and language. Linguist
 s \nhave also begun to study how multimodality features in Internet discou
 rse\, and especially the influence it has on interaction and meaning-makin
 g taking place online.\n \nIn sum\, the Finnish Conference of Linguistics 
 2016 charts questions and challenges that are relevant and important right
  now for understanding the transforming society. It \nalso explores the ro
 le\, relevance and significance of linguistic research for humans and huma
 nity in the rapidly changing world. The invited plenarists address the con
 ference \ntheme from their respective viewpoints:\n\n- Tommi Jantunen: Kur
 kotellen kohti kielioppia − Miten syntaksia on venytetty suomalaisen vii

SUMMARY:Materialist_Discourse_Analysis: Methodological Entanglements

UID:http://linguistlist.org/issues/26/26-5183.html
DESCRIPTION:In this workshop\, we seek to explore how a decidedly material
 ist approach to discourse can be put into practice. Bringing together cont
 ributions from a range of disciplines\, we will think through the methodol
 ogical implications materialism has for Discourse Studies\, and vice versa
 .\n\nFrom the beginning\, discourse analysis (in the broadest sense of the
  term\, as an approach at the intersections of language\, politics\, and s
 ociety) and materialism have been intimately connected. Constituting a rel
 ationship of varying intensity and visibility\, this entanglement is for e
 xample present in Marxist critique of ideology\, materialist semiotics\, R
 ussian formalism\, Critical Theory\, Psychoanalysis\, or ‘French’ stru
 ctural Marxism and discourse analysis. This highly diverse field continues
  to provide different strands of discourse analysis with a complex\, in ma
 ny ways even contradictory notions of materialism\, ranging from essential
 ist/substantialist\, over dialectical\, to post-representationalist ones. 
 The issue is further complicated by the construction of alleged incompatib
 ilities (for example between ‘materialism’ and ‘post-structuralism
 ’) and a battery of dichotomies (materiality/discourse\, discourse/reali
 ty\, language/materiality\, language/reality\, etc.)\, which constitute a 
 prominent focus of theoretical debates. Especially with the emergence of N
 ew Materialism\, material semiotics\, or material culture studies and a re
 newed interest in the materiality of discursive\, social\, and political r
 ealities\, what exactly ‘materialism’ denotes has become the subject o
 f intense debate in the social sciences and humanities again.\n\nParticula
 rly the methodological consequences to be drawn from a decidedly materiali
 st perspective on discourse remain rather opaque\, and are rarely explored
  systematically. Therefore\, the workshop will constitute a space to discu
 ss practical implementations of discourse analysis as a materialist method

SUMMARY:Perspective-indexing Constructions

UID:http://linguistlist.org/issues/26/26-5121.html
DESCRIPTION:The past decade has seen a surge of interest in the topic of (
 inter)subjectivity and the expression of perspective\, with many studies e
 xpanding both the empirical basis of perspective-indexing constructions an
 d our theoretical understanding of how (inter)subjectivity affects grammar
  (e.g. Vandelanotte 2004\, 2009\; Verhagen 2005\; De Smet and Verstraete 2
 006\; Gipper 2011\; Bergqvist 2012\; Gawne 2013\; Bruil 2014\; Ghesquière
  et al. 2014\; Cornillie & De Cock 2015\; San Roque & Bergqvist 2015\; San
  Roque et al. Forthc.\; Dancygier et al. 2016.). As a result\, we are now 
 able to identify a set of discourse contexts and construction types in whi
 ch indexical shifts\, signaling a change in perspective\, tend to occur. T
 ypical perspective-shifting contexts on the complex sentence/clause-level 
 include contexts of reported speech/thought\, explicit epistemic authority
  marking and evidentiality.\n\nHaving acknowledged these constructions and
  contexts as canonical sites for facilitating perspective shifts\, in this
  workshop we examine instances in which\, either through language change o
 r within the dynamics of discourse\, perspective does not shift (we call t
 hese cases of perspective persistence) or does shift\, whereas elements in
  the construction would suggest no or a different shift (we call these irr
 egular perspective shifts). For examples\, see the full call for papers.\n
 \nThe aim of this workshop is to bring together linguists working on diffe
 rent types of perspective-indexing constructions from a wide range of lang
 uages\, to understand how these different types of constructions relate to
  each other\, and what type of perspective shifts they illustrate. More sp
 ecifically\, the topics and questions we want to address include\, but are
  not limited to\, the following: \n\n- What newly described phenomena can 
 add to our understanding of perspective-indexing constructions?\n- What is
  the semantic status of irregular perspective shifts? \n- What are pragmat
 ic conditions for underspecifying such shifts?\n- What are common diachron
 ic sources of perspective-indexing constructions?\n- Can we detect areal b
 iases in the distribution of perspective-indexing constructions?\n-  Does 
 the availability of perspective-indexing constructions covary with the ava
 ilability of morphological systems of evidentiality or egophoricity or yet
  other systems?\n- What parameters are needed for a typology of perspectiv
 e-indexing constructions?\n

DESCRIPTION:« Human 2.0 »\, « hybrided » or « augmented »\, « post/
 transhumanism »\, « robotic artifacts » of the behavior of communicatin
 g and active man\, abundance of touch-screen interfaces: many are today th
 e humanoid « avatars » and other imitations of human presence. So many i
 dentity and self-image issues\, with\, at both ends\, either a promotion o
 r an alteration of bodies. So many questions are involving also the relati
 ons between the body’s discourses with the subjects of language.\n\nThis
  symposium aims to establish a dialogue between social sciences\, neurosci
 ences and engineering sciences. This dialog is anchored within the context
  of a certain societal urgency: in fragmenting our approaches to the body\
 , do we not also weaken the unity of man and of his conceptions? In follow
 ing with previous events linked to similar themes (Researcher in situ\, Im
 mersion through body\, Norms and deviancies\, Montpellier\, 2014\; Interac
 ting bodies\, Lyon\, 2005)\, this international meeting proposes to broach
  the relation between body\, language and technique\, within the framework
  of an unprecedented interdisciplinary dialogue.\n\nIn this perspective\, 
 and because it takes an interest in language related events in their link 
 to social action\, including technical knowledge (Duranti\, 2002\; Fornel\
 , 1994\; Goodwin\, 2000)\, in its diversity (Bornand & Leguy\, 2013\; Lafo
 nt\, 2004\; Londei & Santone\, 2013)\, linguistic anthropology takes a cen
 tral position\, postulating a continuity of communicating bodies\, perceiv
 ing\, feeling\, thinking\, interacting with both natural and artificial en
 vironments\, in an analytic perspective aiming to avoid the atomizing of s
 tudy subjects and their contextual uprooting. Through its interdisciplinar
 y nature\, this perspective is able to open a dialogue between the differe
 nt approaches. In this way\, the studies in this field\, which are always 
 anchored in an ethnographic context\, interrogate the expressions of ratio
 nality and praxis (Goody\, 1996/1999)\, in particular in investigations of
  affects and developmental difficulties (Ochs\, 1989\; Ochs & Solomon\, 20
 10)\, of intentionality (Duranti\, 2015) and of mediated interactions (Jon
 es and Schieffelin\, 2009\; Verdier\, 2014). Most surely\, the models deve
 loped in action neurosciences\, as well as the works in engineering and ro
 botics would benefit in being discussed through the outlook of these conte
 xtualist approaches (Kockelman\, 2013).

DESCRIPTION:The structure and interpretation of nominal phrases of differe
 nt syntactic and semantic complexity have been among the most extensively 
 studied topics in linguistics in the past decades. The literature has esta
 blished various syntax-semantic mappings of noun phrases to express (in)de
 finiteness and genericity across languages\, stemming from the classical s
 tudies on the topics (Carlson 1977\, Kamp 1981\, Heim 1982). Much of the s
 yntactic literature\, adopting the DP Hypothesis of Abney (1987)\, has bee
 n devoted to the internal architecture of the DP (cf. Longobardi 1994\, Za
 mparelli 2000\, Borer 2005\, Alexiadou 2014). Yet another much discussed i
 ssue is the derivation of referential properties of nominal phrases and th
 e syntactic and semantic ingredients involved (e.g.\, articles\, type-shif
 ting\, number specification\, mass and count distinction\, etc.) in buildi
 ng different types of referentiality (Chierchia 1998\, Bouchard 2002\, Day
 al 2004\, Cheng 2012\, Aguilar-Guevara et al. 2014\, Dobrovie-Sorin and Be
 yssade 2014\, among many others). Recently\, a number of experimental stud
 ies have been carried out which complement theoretical investigation (cf. 
 Ionin 2015).\n\nIn this workshop we aim at bringing together researchers i
 nvolved in the study of nominals\, nominalization\, genericity\, specifici
 ty and (in)definiteness in theoretical and experimental linguistics. We we
 lcome work on formal syntax and semantics of nominal phrases in natural la
 nguages\, focusing specifically on the role of Determiner(s) and Number in
  establishing referential properties of the nominal phrase. We also encour
 age submissions on experimental studies on production/processing and L1 an
 d L2 acquisition of referentiality\, article systems and genericity.\n\nPa
 rticular topics to be addressed in the workshop include\, but not limited 
 to\, questions like the following: \n- What is the structure of nominal ex
 pressions in languages with and without articles?\n- To what extent the co
 unt / mass distinction is related to the presence / absence of Number?\n- 
 What is the semantic contribution of Det and Num? How is this contribution
  achieved in languages with no overt determiners and no Number specificati
 on?\n- Why do languages that allow bare nominals and/or null articles also
  allow weak and expletive definites? How are these distinctions expressed 
 in a language with no articles? What is the contribution to meaning of wea
 k and expletive articles? \n- Where is Number to be interpreted within the
  nominal domain? \n- How do different languages refer to kind entities? Sh
 ould a distinction be made between kind entities and pluralities of indivi
 dual objects? How do these differences relate to Number specification?\n- 
 What is the semantic contribution of indefinite determiners? What makes it
  possible for an indefinite expression to contribute to I-genericity or D-
 genericity?\n- Is the taxonomic distinction between kinds and subkinds lin
 guistically relevant? Which are the elements that may constrain either a k
 ind or a subkind reading?\n- How are nominal expressions interpreted at di
 fferent stages in the acquisition of L1 and L2?\n- How does the interpreta
 tion of quantifiers interact with the functional structure within the nomi
 nal domain?\n\nInvited speakers: \n\n- Artemis Alexiadou (Humboldt Univers

SUMMARY:Partiality\, Underspecification\, and Natural Language Processing:
  Special Session at ICAART

DESCRIPTION:Computational and technological developments that incorporate 
 natural language are proliferating. Adequate coverage encounters difficult
  problems related to partiality\, underspecification\, and context-depende
 ncy\, which are signature features of information in nature and natural la
 nguages. Furthermore\, agents (humans or computational systems) can partic
 ipate in informational content\, or influence its flow as information conv
 eyors and interpreters.\n\nThe session covers theoretical work\, advanced 
 applications\, approaches\, and techniques for computational models of inf
 ormation and its presentation by language (artificial\, human\, or natural
  in other ways). The goal is to promote intelligent natural language proce
 ssing and related models of thought\, mental states\, reasoning\, and othe
 r cognitive processes.

DESCRIPTION:Mit dem vom 10. bis 13.10.2016 in Essen stattfindenden Kongres
 s erreicht die 2009 in Salamanca gegründete deutsch-iberische Tagungsreih
 e „Contrastivica“ 2016 ihre vierte Auflage. Das Thema der Tagung 2016 
 lautet „Kontrastive Pragmatik und ihre Vermittlung: Deutsch\, Spanisch u
 nd Portugiesisch im Vergleich“ und fokussiert damit einen für die polit
 ischen und wirtschaftlichen Beziehungen zwischen den deutschsprachigen Lä
 ndern und der iberischen Halbinsel besonders wichtigen Bereich der Kommuni
 kation: Die linguistische Pragmatik untersucht „Sprache als Handeln“ i
 n bestimmten Kontexten\; im Hinblick auf die interkulturelle Kommunikation
  ist es essentiell\, Übereinstimmungen und Differenzen in der Pragmatik w
 issenschaftlich zu erkennen\, zu vermitteln und in der Praxis anzuwenden\,
  um zu einer funktionierenden Kommunikation möglichst ohne Missverständn
 isse zu gelangen. Im Rahmen der Tagung werden sowohl die linguistischen Gr
 undlagen als auch die fremdsprachendidaktischen Implikationen für die Fre
 mdsprachenvermittlung an Schulen\, Hochschulen\, in der Erwachsenenbildung
  und betrieblichen Weiterbildung untersucht.\n\nDie Veranstaltung an der U
 niversität Duisburg-Essen soll Germanisten und Fachleute für Deutsch als
  Fremdsprache der Iberischen Halbinsel und aus dem deutschsprachigen Raum 
 mit Romanisten und Fachleuten für Spanisch\, Portugiesisch\, Katalanisch 
 und Galizisch als Fremdsprache ebenfalls aus den deutschsprachigen Länder
 n\, Spanien und Portugal zusammenführen. Synergien aus den gemeinsamen In
 teressen der spanischen und portugiesischen Germanisten und der deutschspr
 achigen Iberoromanisten kommen im Bereich der kontrastiven Linguistik Span
 isch-Deutsch\, Portugiesisch-Deutsch\, Katalanisch-Deutsch und Galizisch-D
 eutsch in besonderem Maße zum Tragen.\n\nDas Programm sieht folgende Form

 ion of PENTAtrainer in prosody research''\, organized by Yi Xu (University
  College\, London) and Santitham Prom-on (King Mongkut’s University of T
 echnology\, Thailand).\n\nThe special theme of this year’s symposium wil
 l be “Tone in the brain and the world: Bridging linguistic and psycholog
 ical perspectives.” We especially invite contributions which focus on th
 e mental representation of tone and tonal processes\, tone from a cross-li
 nguistic perspective\, or both. The symposium will continue the tradition 
 of the previous four symposia\, aiming to present state-of-the–art resea
 rch on the typological\, phonetic\, phonological\, psycholinguistic\, acqu
 isitional\, and technological aspects of tonal contrasts. We invite contri
 butions from all these areas. Also welcome are contributions on non-tone l
 anguages and the use of tone in poetry or song.

SUMMARY:Exclamation and Intersubjectivity
DTSTART;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20151203T000000
DTEND;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20151204T000000
UID:http://linguistlist.org/issues/26/26-925.html
DESCRIPTION:Most studies on exclamation focus on the speaker’s point of 
 view\, treating it as an isolated phenomenon. This conference aims to expl
 ore the idea that exclamative utterances have an interactional dimension\,
  taking into account the impact that they have on the context in a broad s
 ense\, including the hearer/addressee\, the common ground etc.\n\nExclamat
 ions are often seen as linguistic reactions to unexpected events or words 
 (Martin 1987\; Rett 2011). They are triggered by emotions\, which makes th
 em a phenomenon of the so-called “expressive function of language” (Ja
 kobson 1963-1973). They are often associated with specific properties in t
 he areas of syntax (incomplete structures or wh-clauses\, i.e. ‘gap’-c
 lauses)\, semantics (high degree)\, intonation (see Milner 1978\; Morel in
  Danon-Boileau and Morel 1995\; d’Avis 2001\; Zanuttini and Portner 2003
 \;  Rett 2011).\n       \nStill\, such approaches focus on the speaker’s
  point of view\, while too often leaving aside the role of the hearer/addr
 essee. Even in interactional models\, the interactive dimension is not tac
 kled as such (Vanderveken 1990). This conference aims at questioning the i
 dea that exclamations are only speaker-oriented. They often appear in verb
 al interactions. This raises the question of whether there might exist con
 ventional exclamation triggers\, hence their ability to function as rejoin
 ders to certain speech acts. Moreover\, exclamations could be involved in 
 interactions where a reaction is expected from the hearer (acceptance\, co
 nfirmation\, but also denial or mimicry of the speaker’s attitude by the
  hearer). Some linguists argue that exclamations have a “context change 
 potential” based on their expressive force (Castroviejo Miró 2008\, Che
 rnilovskaya 2014). Finally\, the hearer’s point of view can contribute t
 o the semantic/pragmatic debate regarding the nature of the factivity attr
 ibuted to exclamations be it presupposition or conventional implicature (B
 eyssade 2009\; Abels 2010\, whose tests are mostly based on embedded claus
 es).\n\nRegistration fees: 80 euros (free for students)

DESCRIPTION:The focus of attention of the 2nd International Conference of 
 the Sociolinguistics of Immigration is on the epistemological and methodol
 ogical continuities and discontinuities in the sociolinguistics of immigra
 tion. Several new researches and approaches have begun to emerge in the la
 st few years: translingualism\, polylanguaging\, truncated repertoires\, c
 rossing\, metrolingualism.\n\nTwo main processes have contributed to this 
 change: the epistemological orientation towards postmodernist and critical
  social theories within sociolinguistics as well as applied linguistics\, 
 linguistic anthropology and related disciplines and globalization.\n\nThe 
 aim is to explore these research orientations\, whilst also aiming to crit
 ically discuss these and any (dis)continuities and/or potential links betw
 een ''old'' and ''new'' orientations.

DESCRIPTION:International Conference to discuss the most recent trends in 
 Foreign Language Teaching\, held by the University of Granada\, Spain.\n\n
 Aims and scope of the conference:\n\nLanguage teaching approaches\, method
 s and procedures are constantly undergoing reassessment. New ideas keep em
 erging as the growing complexity of the means of communication and the opp
 ortunities created by technology put language skills to new uses. In addit
 ion\, the political\, social and economic impact of globalization\, the ne
 w demands of the labour market that result from it\, the pursuit of compet
 itiveness\, the challenges of intercultural communication and the diversif
 ication of culture are all phenomena that have opened new perspectives on 
 the central role that foreign languages have come to play in the developme
 nt of contemporary societies.\n\nThis has far-reaching consequences in ter
 ms foreign language learning. Learners have become more aware of these cha
 nging circumstances. They now seek practical solutions for their needs in 
 real contexts\, and this has entailed a radical departure from the school
 ’s traditional teacher-directed curriculum. The Common European Framewor
 k for Reference has helped teachers to rethink their strategies and attitu
 des and has opened new research avenues in the field.\nIt is therefore imp
 ortant for teachers to learn about the latest developments in the field an
 d to get some practical ideas that can help them further develop their tea
 ching skills\, optimize their students’ learning and renew their practic
 es. This conference aims to discuss the new trends in foreign language tea
 ching that result from these new contexts. \n\nEarly bird registration fee

DESCRIPTION:Recent years have seen a growing interest in how children make
  use of available contextual cues for enriching their utterance interpreta
 tion. For some comprehension processes (e.g.\, the incremental referential
  interpretation of color adjectives)\, even very young toddlers around 36 
 months of age seem to make rapid use of both linguistic and extra-­lingui
 stic information (Fernald\, Thorpe & Marchman\, 2010)\, and subtle languag
 e-­specific prosodic preferences are present as early as the first half y
 ear of infants’ lives (Höhle\, Bijeljac-Babic\, Herold\, Weissenborn & 
 Nazzi\, 2009). Children can moreover recruit both language and visual cues
  for word learning (Smith & Yu\, 2008) and pragmatic aspects of the learni
 ng process have been successfully modeled probabilistically (Frank\, Goodm
 an & Tenenbaum\, 2009\; Frank & Goodman\, 2014). Yet\, there is controvers
 y about the kinds of cues that 4-5‐year-­olds can rapidly use during la
 nguage comprehension (Trueswell\, Sekerina\, Hill & Logrip\, 1999\; Zhang 
 & Knoeferle\, 2012). Five-­year-­olds need additional time to effectivel
 y use some (prosodic) cues during comprehension (Ito\, Jincho\, Minai\, Ya
 mane & Mazuka\, 2012)\, and they are not yet able to rapidly draw complex 
 inferences such as those necessary for computing scalar implicature (Huang
  & Snedeker\, 2009) although there is some modulation by other factors of 
 their ability to draw pragmatic inferences (Yoon\, Wu & Frank\, 2015). The
  picture is further complicated by cross-­linguistic variation in the rol
 e of pragmatic inferences for language processing. Accommodating this sort
  of variation in a principle-­based manner is non-­trivial yet an import
 ant endeavor in developing accounts of situated language processing across
  the lifespan. This workshop brings together scientists investigating the 
 role of pragmatic factors in child language processing\, with a focus on c
 hildren’s emerging language and pragmatic abilities and on cross-linguis
 tic variation. Keynote talks by the invited speakers will set the stage fo
 r discussion about how to best characterize the principles underlying prag
 matic processes at developmental stages.

 anguages\,  which will take place in June 22-24\, in Mexico City. The aim 
 of this event is to bring together linguists working on the syntactic and 
 semantic description of languages as well as on the development of theorie
 s in order to discuss answers to two main questions: \n\ni. What formal st
 rategies do natural languages use to express definiteness?\nii. What are t
 he possible meanings of their definite noun phrases?\n\nThe invited speake

SUMMARY:Workshop EUDIA-5 'Linguistic Variation in the Basque Language and 
 Education'

DESCRIPTION:Geographical linguistics (or dialectology) has a long traditio
 n in the Basque language. However\, recent decades have seen a rapid incre
 ase in insights into linguistic structure as well as advances in geographi
 c technology and these two areas have not always been completely matched t
 o each other\, so that one might feel that current linguistic maps leave t
 hings to be desired on both sides. \n\nMany questions still arise. For ins
 tance\, how regions can be identified from mapped data? Is it possible to 
 map grammatical systems instead of individual grammatical features and if 
 so\, how? How can geographic information systems (GIS) best be applied to 
 linguistic data? What can linguistic mapping learn from mapping techniques
  used in other fields of science? \n\nAs far as sociolinguistic variation 
 is concerned\, although research about Basque is very recent\, it is a gro
 wing field in the last few decades. \n\nAnd finally\, how to teach linguis
 tic variation at school? How and when do children realize linguistic varia
 tion? \n\nThis workshop aims to bring together researchers with background
 s in linguistics variation and in teaching linguistic variation in schools

DESCRIPTION:We are pleased to announce the 34th International Conference o
 f the Spanish Association of Applied Linguistics (AESLA) to be held in Ali

 nal and Academic Discourse: an Interdisciplinary Perspective''. \n\nThe Co
 nference will focus on the relationship between the different streams of p
 rofessional and academic discourse in order to analyse the various proposa
 ls that in certain areas and perspectives (humanities\, science\, society\
 , etc.)\, converge in a general framework that can be labelled ''professio
 nal and academic discourse.'' In this sense\, the Conference will deepen t
 he links between languages and professions\, characterized by specific lin
 guistic and discursive structures and\, in most cases\, restricted to smal
 l groups of users.\n\nThe general objectives are:\n\n- To present developm
 ents in the field of professional and academic languages that are being ma
 de within AESLA.\n- To discuss solutions to current problems generated by 
 the specificity of professional and academic languages\, especially proble
 ms regarding communication  and social and technological development.\n- T
 o linking research in specialized languages with productive and business a
 reas of society.\n- To relate advances in research in specialized language
 s to new technologies of communication.\n- To develop models for the appli
 cation of advances in the knowledge of professional and academic languages
  in the educational\, social and technical areas.\n\nAESLA 2016 is pleased

SUMMARY:Language Adapts to Interaction
DTSTART;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20160321T000000

DESCRIPTION:This is a workshop that will be hosted alongside the Evolution
  of Language conference.\n\nLanguage has been shown to be adapted to const
 raints from many domains such as production\, transmission\, memory\, proc
 essing and acquisition. These adaptations and constraints have formed the 
 basis for theories of language evolution\, but arguably the primary ecolog
 y of language is interaction – face-to-face conversation (Levinson\, 200
 6). Taking turns at talk\, repairing problems in communication and organis
 ing conversation into contingent sequences seem completely natural to us\,
  but are in fact highly organised\, tightly integrated systems (Sacks et a
 l.\, 1974) which are not shared by any other species. Therefore\, the infr
 astructure for interaction may provide an insight into the origins of our 
 unique communicative abilities (Mills\, 2014a\; Micklos\, 2014).\n\nIndeed
 \, recent studies on interaction have shown that an approach that emphasis
 es interaction can sharpen our understanding of linguistic universals (Ken
 drick et al.\, 2014\; Dingemanse et al.\, 2015)\, ontogeny and acquisition
  (Hilbrink\, et al. 2015\; Vogt\, 2014)\, on-line processing constraints (
 Bögels et al.\, 2015) and animal signalling (Levinson & Holler\, 2014).\n
 \nThe emerging picture is that the infrastructure for interaction is an ev
 olutionary old requirement for the emergence of a complex linguistic syste
 m\, and for a cooperative\, cumulative culture more generally. These issue
 s are also being integrated into computational models of the cultural evol
 ution of linguistic systems (Vogt and Haasdijk\, 2010\; Roberts\, & Levins
 on\, 2015) and are being explored through studies of experimental semiotic
 s (Mills\, 2014b\; Christensen et al.\, 2016).\n\nThis workshop is interes
 ted in addressing the following questions:\n\n-How did the infrastructure 
 for interaction emerge and how did it shape the emergence of language?\n-W
 hat evidence is there that language structures show adaptation to interact
 ion?\n-How do interactional constraints interact with other domains such a
 s processing?\n-What are the limits of interactional abilities in non-huma
 n animals?\n\nPlease visit the workshop website for more details: http://w

DESCRIPTION:The theme of the conference\, which will be held 28 – 30 Sep
 tember 2016\, is 'Interactions between the Global and the Local'.\n\nThe c
 hallenge for a world in which commercial\, educational\, political and ide
 ological struggles\, facilitated by dramatic developments in media technol
 ogy\, are exposing previously localised enclaves to global attention\, is 
 to somehow reconcile these two seemingly opposed concepts. More than this\
 , to unite the best qualities of both whilst involving minimal sacrifice o
 r compromise\, therefore is to arrive at the harmonious solution of ‘glo
 calisation’\, a phenomenon that connects the global and the local in a p
 roductive and creative manner. Indeed this is an emerging event in many sp
 heres of knowledge\, linguistics\, literature and culture notwithstanding\
 , as globalisation\, internationalisation\, technological advancements and
  new media have encouraged border crossings and the interactions between g
 lobal issues and local variations bearing many implications for language u
 se\, language choice\, language policy and planning\, literacy and pedagog
 y\, identity and culture. In essence\, it is important to study how such g
 local or hybrid forms are used in a variety of cross-cultural contexts and
  genres\, how they function as sites of resistance\, how they refashion or
  reconfigure identities and cultures\, and how they help to authenticate l
 ocal creative writings in postcolonial contexts in order to enhance their 
 literary credibility and aesthetic or rhetorical appeal. \n\nThe conferenc
 e aims to convene academics\, researchers and educators to deliberate and 
 debate on challenges and issues arising from the interactions between the 
 global and the local and their implications on research\, theory and pedag
 ogy.\n\nObjectives:\n\n- To examine the challenges that take place when th
 e global interacts with the local\n- To explore how glocalisation function
 s as a form of resistance and creativity\n- To investigate the theoretical
  and pedagogical implications of this global-local interaction  for the fi
 elds of linguistics\, literature and culture

 lar\, he seeks to analyze and interpret Christian sacramental practices wh
 ile employing the resources of literature\, literary theory\, and Christia
 n theology. His book\, Cormac McCarthy and the Signs of Sacrament: Literat
 ure\, Theology\, and the Moral of Stories (Bloomsbury Academic)\, uncovers
  in contemporary fiction a moral framework that is deeply indebted to trad
 itions of Christian sacramental theology. His next book project will exami
 ne theories of sacrifice in postmodernity alongside Christian understandin
 gs of the atonement and recent American fiction. Other interests include t
 heologies of revelation\, theories of narrative\, the ethics of forgivenes
 s and reconciliation\, contemporary Anglican theology\, and preaching. Pro
 fessor Potts is ordained a priest in the Episcopal Church and has served s
 everal parishes in Massachusetts.

DESCRIPTION:Language processing\, the on-line study of the mental operatio
 ns that occur while we comprehend or produce words and sentences\, has gai
 ned considerable attention in recent years. Whereas substantial knowledge 
 has been gathered on the mental processes involved in L1 processing\, much
  less research has been conducted on bilingual and L2 processing in adults
  and children. The goal of this symposium is to bring together researchers
  who focus on bilingual and L2 adult and child processing. We aim to invok
 e discussions on key questions related to bilingual and L2 processing such
  as the existence of a default processing strategy\, crosslinguistic influ
 ence in L1 and L2 processing\, the role of linguistic distance between L1 
 and L2\, the extent to which the mechanisms used in L1 processing are the 
 same in L2 processing\, and how processing can provide insights into the a
 rchitecture and mechanisms of linguistic representation.\n\nInvited Speake

 LLT) conference is an annual meeting held in North America that focuses on
  the exchange of research on pronunciation pedagogy and development. The t
 heme of the 2016 conference is The Role of Technology in L2 Pronunciation 
 Teaching and Learning. This theme is timely: In the last five years there 
 has been an astonishing growth in smartphone apps and websites geared to s
 econd language (L2) pronunciation\, or accent reduction. \n\nIn addition t
 o the plenary\, the regular refereed sessions\, and the poster session\, t
 here are two other key features to this conference: a Roundtable of intern
 ational experts in L2 pronunciation research and technology\, and a Round 
 Robin session for practitioners in which several teacher educators will pr
 ovide Tips and Strategies for evidenced-based approaches to teaching pronu

DESCRIPTION:With globalization\, English has won the status of a Lingua Fr
 anca around the world and a de-facto second language in multilingual conte
 xts. In Tunisia\, it has been gaining more ground as a means of communicat
 ion and has become an asset for employability both locally and internation
 ally. This is bound to affect various facets of ELT: curriculum design\, m
 ethodology\, materials development\, and the measurement of learning outco
 mes and program success. In addition to the need to balance local and glob
 al concerns\, there is a growing awareness of the need to attend to cross-
 cultural and pragmatic dimensions and to the development of 21st century s
 kills.\n\nIt is in this context that Tunisia TESOL will organize its third
  International Conference on ELT in the 21st Century: Global and Local Con
 cerns. Proposals of papers and workshops can focus on\, but are not restri
 cted to\, the following sub-themes:\n\n- The roles of ELT teachers in the 
 21st century\n- Enhancing learner autonomy\n- Critical thinking skills and
  the learning of English\n- Cultural values in local and global communicat
 ion\n- Learning technologies in ELT and 21st century skills\n- Maintaining
  teacher and learner motivation\n- Adapting contents\, methods and approac
 hes to local contexts\n- Assessing English proficiency/achievement in the 
 21st century\n- English varieties to teach and the myth and reality of the
  ''native speaker''\n- Continuous professional development\n- ELT and inte
 rcultural communication\n- Materials development\n- ELT program evaluation
 \n- Experiential learning in modern language education\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Main Conference:\n\nCorpus-assisted discourse studies (CADS) i
 nvestigate the employment of corpus techniques to shed light on aspects of
  language used for communicative purposes or\, put another way\, to analys
 e how language is used to (attempt to) influence the beliefs and behaviour
  of other people.\n\nWe welcome proposals on the corpus-assisted analysis 
 of\, for instance:\n\n- Discourse organisation\n- Political\, institutiona
 l and media texts (including social media)\n- Social science and social po
 licy issues\n- Cultural and cross-cultural topics\n- Discourse implication
 s in translation studies\n- Discourse effects in literary texts\n- Notably
  thorny issues for corpus research like irony\, metaphor and (im) politene
 ss\;\nand\, indeed\, of any study of discourse where the three corpus ling
 uistics virtues of Collecting\, Counting and Collating are deemed to have 
 enabled\, assisted\, enhanced and even perhaps complicated the data analys
 is. Studies of how things are done across different discourse types or of 
 how they have developed over recent periods of time are also highly releva
 nt.\n\nWe also welcome papers which include considerations on the general 
 methodological and philosophical issues pertaining to CADS.\n \nWorkshop: 
 Festival of Methods (June 30)\n\nWe have introduced a new regular feature 
 into the Corpus & Discourse conference series in which we explore the effe
 cts of our choice of tools\, methods and approaches. Ahead of each confere
 nce in the series\, a research topic will be set which researchers are inv
 ite to tackle and then time will be set aside at the conference itself for
  presentation of findings and extended discussion on the kinds of analyses
  which were developed. We are calling this new kind of panel event the Fes
 tival of Methods because we hope it will be an engaging exploration and ce
 lebration of the range of methods we have at our disposal. \n\nResearch to
 pic: How is Ireland / being Irish represented in UK parliamentary discours
 e?\nCorpus: Hansard Corpus (from Mark Davies’s BYU suite)\n\nParticipant
 s are encouraged to approach the topic from any aspect. They may make as l
 ittle or as much use of corpus tools as they wish\, and approaches using d
 ifferent discourse analytic frames are very welcome. Collaborative contrib

DESCRIPTION:Ten years in the life of a conference can be considered a note
 worthy timespan. After in the past decade we dealt with various relevant s
 ocial and humanistic topics such as politics\, globalization\, identity\, 
 change\, communication\, values\, marginalization\, discourse and meaning\
 , from the point of view of literary studies and linguistics\, for the the
 me of our 10th anniversary conference we have chosen time\, as one of the 
 fundamental domains of human experience. Language\, literature and time ar
 e related in many ways. Most basically\, both language and literature are 
 the achievements of the human mind which are situated in time\, and are us
 ed and developed in time\, as historically and culturally determined. Furt
 her\, one of the most fascinating mental feats is that human beings use la
 nguage to situate and arrange events in time\, that is\, they use language
  as a means to structure\, represent and conceptualize time. Finally\, lit
 erature expands our understanding of time and the expression of our intell
 ectual perception and emotional reactions to the temporal\, atemporal and 
 omnitemporal\, through the interplay of various stylistic devices\, chrono
 logy\, temporal distortion\, fragmentation and non-linearity.\n\nThe aim o
 f the conference Language\, Literature\, Time is to address the phenomenon
  of time and the temporal perspective from the point of view of literary a
 nd linguistic disciplines\, not only through historical literary and lingu
 istic research\, but also any other which is focused on formal\, structura
 l and genre devices for conceptualizing and expressing time\, temporal rel
 ations and the development of language forms\, functions and the approache
 s to literary and linguistic studies. \n\nConference languages are English
  and Serbian\, for 15-minute presentations followed by 5 minute discussion
  time.

 HL aims at researchers working with Low Resource Languages - a special foc

 ge resources and computational models for the study of low resource langua
 ges (LRLs) has been constantly growing. This concerns especially historica
 l LRLs for which authentic digitized material is hardly available. Since f
 or most historical languages data is sparse one may consider Wikipedia and
  related projects (on Old English\, Gothic\, Old Church Slavonic\, Latin e
 tc.) to overcome data sparseness. This approach investigates to what exten
 t such data can be useful for modeling historical languages. The LRL works
 hop addresses scholars working on these and related topics using LRL corpo

DESCRIPTION:Connecting the Dots in a Glocalized World 2016 will provide a 
 forum for the exchange of ideas in the four main disciplines of language\,
  linguistics\, literature and translation. As the title for the conference
  suggests\, the aim is to highlight the relationship between global themes
  and local practices. The focus thus is on the under-examined interactions
  that occur as globalization takes on negotiated forms in different contex
 ts. With an emphasis on interdisciplinary studies and methodologies\, the 
 conference will centralize research which extends theory\, methodology and
  application\; it will also highlight research that weds local scholarly a
 nd pedagogical projects with global concerns. Proposals that aim to addres
 s either of these two areas\, and which emphasize exploratory\, experiment
 al research or reconstructed concepts\, frameworks of analysis\, or approa
 ches\, are particularly welcome. \n\nProposals which fall outside the focu

DESCRIPTION:It is a pleasure to invite you to the International Conference
  on the Advances in Computational Analysis of Political Text - POLTEXT 201
 6.\n\nTechnological developments\, digital media\, and advances in open go
 vernment practices have made a vast amount of information available for so
 cial scientists. Most of this information is available as text.\n\nNews po
 rtals disseminate political stories at unprecedented rates\, politicians a
 nd political elites advertise their own messages through social media outl
 ets and crowdsourcing provides new affordable and quick venues for asking 
 citizens what they think about politics. With political texts at our finge
 rtips\, vexing research questions are emerging.\n\nExtracting\, organizing
 \, and analyzing large amounts of textual information can be quite resourc
 e-intensive with many political scientists lacking the skills necessary fo
 r dealing with such data. Fortunately\, recent developments of cutting edg
 e computational technologies such as natural language-processing\, machine
  learning\, and information extraction techniques has made research utiliz
 ing text-as-data more accessible and appealing.\n\nOn the other hand\, com
 putational scholars equipped with novel technologies and linguistic soluti
 ons often have less experience with social science theories and less conte
 xtual knowledge about political data. There is a mutual benefit in connect
 ing disparate worlds of computational text analysis and political science 
 in analyzing political research problems. The aim of this conference is to
  facilitate this multidisciplinary cooperation.

DESCRIPTION:English Language Teaching today is challenging\, especially wi
 th the rise of “world Englishes\,” it has become more diverse in its c
 ultures and contexts. In education\, research provides information on mult
 iple phenomena such as the efficacy of various instructional approaches\, 
 achievement differences between social groups and across countries and the
  many factors that contribute to school improvement in general (Cummins an
 d Davison 2007). With your participation in this conference\, we will not 
 only present a range of studies exploring English language teaching approa
 ches\, methodologies\, technologies and common practices but work together
  and develop sustainable professional networks focused on the long term ad
 vancement of ELT related research and knowledge.

 che LATICE et LLTA\, la huitième édition du colloque annuel INFOL@NGUES 
 2016 du 28 au 30 avril 2016 à Béja. Durant les éditions précédentes\,
  plusieurs  chercheurs (linguistes et informaticiens) appartenant à des o
 rganismes de recherches nationaux et internationaux ont contribué à la r
 éussite de cet événement scientifique d’envergure.\n\nLa huitième é
 dition INFOL@NGUES 2016 ambitionne d’approfondir les recherches dans ce 
 domaine en rapport avec les problématiques récentes. Elle porte sur plus
 ieurs thématiques et essentiellement sur le traitement automatique des la
 ngues.\n\nLes langues se présentent comme des données complexes vu qu’
 elles possèdent des caractéristiques lexicales\, syntaxiques et stylisti
 ques qui leur sont propres. Etudier et/ou analyser ces différents aspects
  a toujours été l’une des préoccupations majeures de la communauté s
 cientifique. Celle-ci se trouve face à des défis\, en perpétuelle évol
 ution\,  qu’elle doit lever. En effet\, avec la grande évolution des ou
 tils informatiques (Matériels et logiciels) et le développement de l’I
 nternet\, de nouvelles applications fondées sur le traitement automatique
  des langues apparaissent. D´où le besoin de développer des outils perf
 ormants pour analyser et traiter les données textuelles. Cet objectif  ne
  peut être atteint qu’à travers une étroite collaboration entre infor
 maticiens et linguistes. C’est précisément dans cette lignée que s’
 inscrivent les objectifs assignés au colloque INFOL@NGUES 2016.\n\nCe col
 loque est une occasion pour rendre compte des nouveaux développements en 
 matière de traitement informatique des langues. C’est aussi une tribune
  pour les jeunes chercheurs en vue de présenter et discuter\, en présenc
 e de spécialistes\, l’avancement de leurs travaux de recherche ayant tr
 ait aux thèmes abordés.

DESCRIPTION:The Department of Modern Languages at Télécom Bretagne (Fran
 ce) and the University of Padua (Italy) are very pleased to welcome abstra
 ct submission for the GLAT International Conference 2016 which will take p
 lace in Padua on May 17-19\, 2016.\n\nThe conference will focus on mediati
 on and intercultural dialogue.\n\nMediation can be seen as a “unifying c
 oncept\, bringing together professional and pedagogical practices from eve
 ry aspect of communication”\, to quote John Humbley\, and also as a conc
 ept representing a “process of ethical communication”\, as defined by 
 Michèle Guillaume-Hofnung. Through mediation\, one can thus bring togethe
 r practice and professions\, as well as social activities and human relati
 ons.\n\nMediation has had growing significance in the heterogeneous societ
 ies of today\, where the opposition of viewpoints\, visions\, needs and in
 terests among minority and majority groups\, e.g. between immigrant and es
 tablished communities\, represent more and more frequent scenarios. Instit
 utions are not always able to provide quick responses to daily situations 
 of incomprehension and of rejection of alterity (linguistic\, physical\, p
 sychological\, sexual and social)\, degradation\, urban violence\, or extr
 emism.\n\nMediation has proven to be the most immediate\, most flexible in
 strument to intervene in such situations. Mediation makes it possible to m
 ake the implicit explicit\, to encourage listening and to engage in dialog
 ue with others. This mediation is made possible by a variety of mediators 
 (citizen\, cultural\, neighborhood\, street\, city\, family\, institutiona
 l\, judicial\, linguistic\, health\, educational\, social\, etc.)\, as wel
 l as by communication facilitators (social workers\, researchers\, teacher
 s\, psychologists\, forum moderators\, special interest groups\, online or
  offline\, etc.).\n\nIn order for mediation to take place\, the mediator a
 nd the people concerned must agree on the words they use. The latter must 
 also recognize the mediator as a third party with respect to their world v
 iews. The mediator must understand that certain words reveal personal valu
 es and that a particular wording can calm minds and inspire trust. Trainin
 g must be available to allow mediators to master not only the theoretical 
 principles of mediation\, but also the linguistic interactions.\n\nWe hope
  to explore this theme with you in a spirit of conviviality and multilingu
 alism.\n\nKeynote Speakers: \n\nWe are happy to welcome 4 keynote speakers

DESCRIPTION:Publishing language resources under open licenses and linking 
 them together has been an area of increasing interest in academic circles\
 , including applied linguistics\, lexicography\, natural language processi
 ng and information technology. It facilitates the exchange of knowledge an
 d information across disciplines as well as between academia and the IT bu
 siness. By collocating the 5th edition of the workshop series with LREC 20
 16\, we encourage this interdisciplinary community to present and to discu
 ss use cases\, experiences\, best practices\, recommendations and technolo
 gies among each other and in interaction with the language resource commun
 ity. We particularly invite contributions discussing the application of th
 e Linked Open Data paradigm to linguistic data as it might provide an impo
 rtant step towards making linguistic data: i) easily and uniformly queryab
 le\, ii) interoperable and iii) sharable over the Web using open standards
  such as the HTTP protocol and the RDF data model.\n\nWhile it has been sh
 own that Linked Data has significant value for the management of language 
 resources in the Web\, the practice is still far from being an accepted st
 andard in the community. Thus\, it is important that we continue to push t
 he development and adoption of Linked Data technologies among creators of 
 language resources. In particular\, Linked Data's ability to increase the 
 quality\, interoperability and availability of data on the Web has lead us
  to focus on managing\, improving and using language resources on the Web 
 as a key focus for this year's workshop.

DESCRIPTION:Multilingualism appears in most societies of the world. Curren
 t socio-political transformations\, in particular the increasing migration
  processes\, give rise to new multi-ethnic and multilingual situations tha
 t motivate changes in languages and communities. This conference focuses o
 n the impact of these processes in two areas: (a) linguistic phenomena\, a
 nd (b) phenomena related to group identities. \n\nSome primary questions w
 hich may be explored at the conference are:\n\nLanguage Change:\n\n- What 
 is the impact of increasing multilingualism in the different levels of lin
 guistic structure (phonology\, morphology\, syntax\, lexicon)? \n- What is
  the relation between the phenomena in multilingual situations to the gene
 ralizations about language contact and grammar?\n- How can we distinguish 
 between effects of language contact (in bilingual societies) and effects o
 f language attrition (in the younger generations of threatened languages)?
 \n\nIdentity:\n\n- What role does language contact play in the process of 
 forming\, transforming\, and negotiating group identities? \n- How are the
 se multifaceted identities displayed in interaction?\n- Are there contexts
  in which heritage languages may be or may become less important for group
  belonging – for example contexts in which religious\, political or soci
 al affiliation take priority over language competences?\n\nLanguage change
  and identity:\n\n- How do language change and changing identities interac
 t?\n\nConference Description:\n\nA three-day conference on “The impact o
 f socio-political transformations on language and identity” will take pl

 e issue identified above is expected to be significant for teachers\, lear
 ners\, researchers and educationists in general. The importance of the sub
 ject will be seen in the exchange of experiences and expertise among local
  and foreign interveners in a way that raises the students’ awareness in
  the English department that debates on intercultural issues will serve th
 em in many sorts of ways. This meeting provides an excellent opportunity t
 o share the results of the teachers and students research with a varied au

DESCRIPTION:Lugares del hispanismo en un mundo globalizado\n\nNos damos cu
 enta de que el concepto del hispanismo puede ser considerado como término
  del lenguaje objeto o del metalenguaje (el hispanismo como constituyente 
 del mundo globalizado o como saber que permite exponer e interpretar ese m
 undo globalizado). Asimismo\, el hispanismo puede ser descrito desde una p
 erspectiva histórica y diacrónica o desde una perspectiva sistemática y
  sincrónica (los fenómenos del hispanismo en el transcurso del tiempo o 
 en el marco del mundo actual). Ninguna de estas opciones debe ser descarta
 da. Por ello\, el 21 Congreso de Hispanistas que se celebrará en Múnich 
 invita a enfocar y discutir a todos los niveles esta vasta temática que c
 oncierne todas las disciplinas del hispanismo y cuya urgencia se hace cada
  vez más patente. Como en los anteriores congresos\, aparte de conferenci
 as plenarias y actos culturales\, el trabajo se realizará en secciones qu
 e abarcarán las cinco disciplinas principales del hispanismo como es conc
 ebido en Alemania:\n\n- Historia de la lengua y lingüística\n- Estudios 
 literarios y cinematográficos\n- Estudios culturales y sobre los medios d
 e comunicación \n- Estudios sobre la traducción (“traductología”)\n
 - Didáctica del español como lengua extranjera.

DESCRIPTION:The topic of the 2016 symposium is the interface between langu
 age and migration and how the language situation\, planning and policies i
 n various countries\, Asia in particular\, are managed as a result of in-m
 igration or out-migration. As the world refugee crisis intensifies discuss
 ion has reopened on issues concerning the role of language in internationa
 l migration: language and new citizenship\, language proficiency policies 
 and requirements\, migration to countries of language proximity\, language
  change\, terminologies (e.g. migrant vs refugee)\, language loss and main
 tenance\, how language shapes or influences migration. Within this general
  theme\, language and migration will be explored in its pedagogical\, hist
 orical\, and social frameworks. \n\nThe symposium is organized by the Ling
 uapax Asia Committee. Linguapax Asia works in partnership with the Linguap
 ax Institute\, a non-governmental organization affiliated with UNESCO and 
 located in Barcelona\, Spain. The Asian associate of the Linguapax Institu
 te\, Linguapax Asia carries out the objectives of both the Linguapax Insti

DESCRIPTION:The main theme of the conference will be the status of the Eng
 lish language in higher education in the Arab World with special emphasis 
 on English Studies in Morocco. Motivation for such a focus comes from the 
 controversies that have emerged as a result a noticeable disparity between
  the rapidly-changing status of the English language in the world and in M
 orocco and the continuous efforts on the part of policy-makers to accompan
 y these changes. One main concern is to frame these efforts within a gener
 al curriculum development approach in order to make sense of the various r
 eform versions\, their objectives\, focus\, and effectiveness. This has im
 plications not only for English Studies\, but also for two other areas nam
 ely English as part of the Language and Communication module and English a
 s a teaching medium for content subjects in other departments and facultie
 s.\n\nThe objective of the conference is to bring together researchers and
  practitioners in the field of English Language Teaching at the university
  level over discussions of various themes building upon their classroom ex
 periences and field research tracking day to day challenges and possibilit
 ies. The conference will address a range of critically important themes re
 levant to the situation of English in higher education with a focus on met
 hodological issues pertaining to emerging challenges of the 21st century. 
 While the teaching of English\, in particular\, has benefited from researc
 h in applied linguistics and TEFL to reform its methodologies\, though con
 troversial\, the situation in other areas is quite unclear.\n\nThe confere
 nce will feature plenary speakers among some of the leading researchers in
  the field. We are inviting proposals for paper presentations in the field
 s of Linguistics\, Applied Linguistics\, Cultural Studies\, Translation\, 
 and Literature.\n\nInformation regarding conference themes\, paper submiss

 \n\nMiLAct16 is part of the Newton Fund project Mind\, language and action
 : Investigating the connections between the physical and human realities\,
  generously supported by the British Academy. Its principal aim is to brin
 g together philosophers working in the areas of Mind\, Language and Action
 \, as well as in correlated fields such as Linguistics and Cognitive Scien
 ces\, to discuss the nature of the relationship between the physical and h
 uman realities.\n\nOne central question that guides philosophical inquiry 
 (and one that is especially emphasized in the work of John Searle) is how 
 the human reality consisting of various complex organizations such as lang
 uage and social institutions is generated by the purely physical reality a
 s described by the natural sciences. How the human reality of thought\, me
 aning and free will can fit in a causally closed physical reality\, in whi
 ch purportedly only physical causes can produce physical effects?\n\nA num
 ber of traditional debates derive from such a crucial question. The mind/b
 ody problem in its diverse formulations is essentially the problem of how 
 the apparently immaterial reality of thoughts and sensations can affect\, 
 and be affected by\, physical events. Similarly\, certain theories of mean
 ing try to account for the capacity of purely physical sounds and inscript
 ions to get people to perform all sorts of actions.\n\nIn the philosophy o
 f language\, some of the relevant figures to the present proposal are the 
 late Wittgenstein\, Austin\, Strawson\, Grice and Searle\, among others. T
 hese philosophers contributed to moving the discussion away from a purely 
 abstract conception of meaning (e.g.\, Frege’s ‘third-realm’ of Sinn
 ) by emphasizing the role of human activity as a crucial component of ling
 uistic meaning. Wittgenstein’s lemma “meaning is use”\, Austin/Searl
 e’s notion of a speech act\, Strawson’s notion of speaker’s meaning\
 , and Grice’s intentionalistic views on meaning are examples of such a s
 trategy. In his work in the philosophy of action\, Searle further attempte
 d to reduce the reality of human institutions to a particularly interestin
 g kind of speech acts that he called declarations.\n\nThis intellectual ev
 olution thus paved the way to a fruitful research agenda linking the human
  realities of mind\, language and social institutions\, to the more fundam
 ental and so to speak meaningless reality described by natural sciences. T
 his is the overall landscape in which the present project is designed to f
 it in.\n \nFor further information contact milact2016@gmail.com.\nFor upda

DESCRIPTION:Linguistic annotation of natural language corpora is the backb
 one of supervised methods for statistical natural language processing. It 
 also provides valuable data for evaluation of both rule-based and supervis
 ed systems and can help formalize and study linguistic phenomena. \n\nThe 
 LAW provides a forum for presentation and discussion of innovative researc
 h on all aspects of linguistic annotation\, including creation/evaluation 
 of annotation schemes\, methods for automatic and manual annotation\, use 
 and evaluation of annotation software and frameworks\, representation of l
 inguistic data and annotations\, evaluation of manual and automatically-pr
 oduced annotations\, etc. \n\nWe encourage submission of papers relating t
 o this year's theme: Evaluation of Annotation Quality.\n\nThis special the
 me considers current practice in evaluation of linguistic annotations and 
 its successes and failures by asking questions such as: How are we as a co
 mmunity measuring inter-annotator agreement to date\, and are there sounde
 r ways to measure it? How can we estimate the annotation quality of existi
 ng resources\, and what can be done to document annotated data to help oth
 ers assess its reliability? \n\nWe encourage submissions addressing the fo
 llowing topics related to the special theme:\n\n- How agreement is measure
 d in various (new or existing) annotation projects\, and what the differen
 t scores tell us in each case\n- Good acceptance thresholds for different 
 annotation tasks and metrics\, and/or how to determine them\n- Previously 
 proposed but not widely used measures for agreement or annotation quality\
 n- Proposals for quantitative or qualitative methods to measure agreement 
 or annotation quality\n- Proposals for documentation of published resource
 s to support their evaluation\, means and methods to achieve community eva
 luation of linguistically-annotated resources\, etc.\n\n\nWorkshop Chairs:

DESCRIPTION:Recent years have witnessed an upsurge in the quantity of avai
 lable digital research data\, offering new insights and opportunities for 
 improved understanding. Following advances in Natural Language Processing 
 (NLP)\, Text and data mining (TDM) is emerging as an invaluable tool for h
 arnessing the power of structured and unstructured content and data. Hidde
 n and new knowledge can be discovered by using TDM at multiple levels and 
 in multiple dimensions. However\, text mining and NLP solutions are not ea
 sy to discover and use\, nor are they easy to combine for end users.\n\nMu
 ltiple efforts are being undertaken world-wide to create TDM and NLP platf
 orms. These platforms are targeted at specific research communities\, typi
 cally researchers in a particular location\, e.g. OpenMinTeD\, CLARIN (Eur
 ope)\, ALVEO (Australia)\, or LAPPS (USA). All of these platforms face sim
 ilar problems in the following areas: discovery of content and analytics c
 apabilities\, integration of knowledge resources\, legal and licensing asp
 ects\, data representation\, and analytics workflow specification and exec
 ution.\n\nThe goal of cross-platform interoperability raises many problems
 . At the level of content\, metadata\, language resources\, and text annot
 ations\, we use different data representations and vocabularies. At the le
 vel of workflows\, there is no uniform process model that allows platforms
  to smoothly interact. The licensing status of content\, resources\, analy
 tics\, and of the output created by a combination of such licenses is diff
 icult to determine and there is currently no way to reliably exchange such
  information between platforms. User identity management is often tightly 
 coupled to the licensing requirements and likewise an impediment for cross
 -platform interoperability.

DESCRIPTION:Social media are an inherent part of life in the 21st century 
 and should be accessible to anyone. People who are to some extent function
 ally illiterate are currently excluded from properly using social media su
 ch as Twitter\, Facebook\, WhatsApp.\n\nIn order to overcome this exclusio
 n\, we need NLP tools and resources adapted to the needs of\, among others
 \, people with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities\, like Fragi
 le X-syndrome\, Down syndrome\, or SLI\, people with limited communication
  skills due to illness or accident\, (deaf) people with a sign language as
  mother tongue\, migrants wanting to socially integrate and communicate in
  a language / script they do not yet master\, elderly people with diminish
 ing language skills. \n\nWhich NLP techniques are used in order to allow t
 hese groups to be socially included and use social media? What do we need 
 in order to build applications for these groups of users?\n\nThe main topi
 cs of interest in this workshop are:\n\n- tools for social inclusion\n- co
 nversion techniques between non-verbal and verbal systems\n- non-standard 
 spelling or grammar correction\n- (non-verbal) input methods\n- non-standa
 rd speech input\n- text modification (simplification\, rephrasing) for non
 -standard input\n- in vivo evaluation\n- available resources / corpora (+ 
 legal issues\, privacy)\n- adaptivity (level of illiterateness\, culture\,
  age\, …)\n- reusability in other domains (second language learning\, In
 ternet-of-Things dialogue systems)

SUMMARY:Referential Semantics One Step Further

DESCRIPTION:Referential semantics one step further: Incorporating insights
  from conceptual and distributional approaches to meaning\n\nThough refere
 ntial approaches to semantics have proven very successful at providing mea
 ningful analyses for a wide range of natural language data\, some importan
 t phenomena\, particularly involving the lexicon\, have eluded insightful 
 treatment. Notions going beyond reference and truth have been influencing 
 referential semantics for years\, but the interest in incorporating result
 s and ideas from conceptually-oriented semantics into referential approach
 es is noticeably increasing\, as seen in the recent series of workshops de
 voted to the issue (see also e.g. Hamm et al. 2009\, Carlson 2010). In par
 allel\, interest has also grown in bringing related insights from cognitiv
 ely-informed distributional models of meaning into formal semantics (Lenci
  2008\, Copestake & Herbelot 2012\, Baroni et al. 2014). \n\nThe aim of th
 is workshop is to promote a 3-way dialog among these approaches in order t
 o clarify natural points of contact and to generate specific hypotheses ab
 out how to improve the explanatory capacity of referential models in a pri
 ncipled and testable manner. We build from referential models given the em
 pirical evidence that reference (whether to real or imaginary objects) is 
 a fundamental part of linguistic communication. Crucially\, however\, refe
 rence makes use of complex descriptive content. Cognitive/conceptual appro
 aches place greater emphasis precisely on the richness of descriptive cont
 ent and richer theories of descriptive content clearly lead to richer acco
 unts of compositional phenomena. On the other hand\, cognitive models are 
 laborious to construct\, difficult to implement/test\, and face challenges
  in grounding. Compositional distributional models can help with the analy
 sis of rich descriptive content but are not currently suited to dealing wi
 th reference. We therefore consider the incorporation of insights from con
 ceptual and distributional models into referential approaches\, rather tha
 n the reverse\, the most viable strategy.\n\nINVITED SPEAKERS\nBarbara Par

DESCRIPTION:In recent years there has been a vivid discussion in Japan and
  elsewhere about language learning curriculums and frameworks\, especially
  the Council of Europe’s Common European Framework of Reference for Lang
 uages (CEFR). It is important to be aware that the CEFR and its can do sta
 tements must be adapted and changed to suit the specific context they serv
 e. The basic theme of this project focuses on the implementation of the CE
 FR in language education institutions\, with a focus on generating ideas o
 f current practice that can be adapted and implemented by others. While th
 is project is centred on Japan\, we also encourage poster submissions from
  other regions of Asia and beyond.\n\nThe March 2016 symposium will featur
 e plenary speakers and workshops about the implementation of the CEFR in i
 nstitutions. We will make time available for interactive poster presentati
 ons\, which outline pedagogical processes\, both on an institutional and c
 lassroom level. We hope this will be time to openly exchange ideas.\n\nSym

DESCRIPTION:We are pleased to announce the workshop on Computational Appro
 aches to Deception Detection to be held in conjunction with the main NAACL
  2016 conference in San Diego\, California on 12-17 June 2016.\n \nMotivat
 ion:\n\nDetecting deception in communications has been a challenge through
 out history. Since the early 20th century\, however\, a number of technolo
 gies have been developed\, specifically aimed at unmasking deception prima
 rily through the identification and analysis of cues possibly associated w
 ith false statements. The cues have varied widely\, ranging from physiolog
 ical measurements to non-verbal and verbal behaviors.\n\nSeveral areas of 
 natural language processing\, including text classification\, spoken langu
 age processing\, sentiment analysis\, and discourse are now addressing the
  descriptive criteria associated with deception. New approaches also prese
 nt the opportunity to combine information from different modalities\; for 
 example\, computational approaches to the analysis of facial expressions m
 ay also play a role in the identification of deceptive language.\n\nIn 201
 2 we organized a full-day workshop entitled “Computational Approaches to
  Deception Detection” for the EACL meeting in Avignon\, France. Fourteen
  papers were delivered at the meeting to an audience of 31 attendees. Sinc
 e then\, there has been growing interest in deception detection among the 
 computational linguistics community\, as evidenced by the 24+ conference a
 nd journal papers published since 2012.\n\nFour years out from EACL2012\, 
 we think it is time to create a new event where researchers in computation
 al linguistics who deal with deception detection in any application area c
 an share their methods and present their accomplishments.\n\nThe workshop 
 on Computational Approaches to Deception Detection\, is sponsored by the N
 orth American chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NA
 ACL) and is part of the NAACL 2016 conference to be held in San Diego\, Ca
 lifornia on 12-17 June 2016.\n  \nProgram Committee:\n\nAngela Almela\, Un

DESCRIPTION:The Language Centre of the University of Calabria is pleased t
 o announce the XIV CercleS International Conference entitled Enhancing Lea
 rners’ Creative and Critical Thinking: The Role of University Language C
 entres. The Conference will be held on 22-23-24 September 2016.\n\nThe aim
  of the Conference is to create an occasion for scholars\, practitioners a
 nd project managers to share ideas about research and didactics related to
  language learning and teaching. The Conference wants to offer the opportu
 nity for a three-day collaborative and friendly debate which will involve 
 the many members of the Associations of Language Centres in Europe who\, t
 hanks to their varied working and geographical backgrounds\, will enrich t
 he conference discussions. It is\, indeed\, our wish to embrace different 
 perspectives in order to promote in-depth reflection on issues related to 
 the well-being of language students and of University Language Centres.\n\
 nCreativity and Critical thinking are concepts of paramount importance for
  learners’ global development process\, both from a cultural and social 
 point of view as well as from a linguistic and multilingual perspective. W
 e strongly believe that it is the duty of language scholars to never forge
 t the role that languages have in society and the role that creativity and
  critical thinking\, in particular\, have in language acquisition and lear
 ning. Teaching actions should therefore encourage learners to bring out al
 l of their potential\, which is often hidden inside and silently waiting f
 or the right stimulus to help create meaningful actions.\n\nTopics have be
 en chosen to include broad research areas\, with interrelated sub-issues\,
  which have favoured important changes in the field of language learning a
 nd teaching and which foster significant debate on how languages naturally
  interweave with other academic disciplines. They are intentionally broad 
 so as to encourage the sharing of a wider range of backgrounds\, findings\
 , expertise\, ideas and discussions.\n\nKeynote speakers:\n\nManuel Célio

DESCRIPTION:The Dene Languages Conference is the world's most important an
 nual conference for the study of Dene (Athabascan) languages\, bringing to
 gether linguists\, educators\, language learners\, and language activists 
 from all parts of Denendeh and beyond.  The theme for this year’s confer
 ence is “Language and History”.  There will also be a special session 
 on “Standardization and Variation”.\n\nInvited Speakers:\nKeren Rice (
 University of Toronto)\nLeslie Saxon (University of Victoria)\nMichael Kra
 uss (Alaska Native Language Center)\nJames Kari (Alaska Native Language Ce
 nter)\n\nKeynote Speaker:\nFred Sangris (Yellowknives Dene First Nation)\n
 \nConference Theme: “Language and History”\n\nLanguage is in many ways
  a product of history.  Language changes over time\, and the languages we 
 speak today are the result of many changes accumulated over thousands of y
 ears.  At the same time\, Dene languages are known to be remarkably conser
 vative\, particularly in their verb system\, where many seemingly irregula
 r or fossilized patterns provide a direct window into the linguistic past.
   Finally\, learning one’s traditional language creates\, for many peopl
 e\, a sense of connection with history\, with one’s ancestors\, and with
  one’s traditional lands.

DESCRIPTION:Confirmed Plenary Speakers:\n\nSally McConnell-Ginet\nMary Buc
 holtz\nPeter A. Jackson\nJie Yang\nTommaso Milani\nKira Hall\n\nThe theme 
 for IGALA 9 is ''Time and Transition: Gender\, sexuality\, discourse and l
 anguage''\n\nThis theme reflects Hong Kong\, a city in which time and tran
 sition are unusually salient and omnipresent as themes in social life. Hon
 g Kong is a place in transition like many others\, but its transition is t
 aking place on simultaneous\, variant timescales. The concept of “One Co
 untry\, Two Systems” frames its relationship with China\, a nation whose
  own changes are happening apace and on a superpower scale. At the same ti
 me Hong Kong has its own ‘system’\, drawing on a very different past a
 s it contemplates a future in which these two timescales will converge.  W
 orking in this context has prompted the organizers to reflect on timescale
 s and transitions in relation to this conference. How do time and transiti
 on interact with gender\, sexuality\, discourse and language? And how is t
 his interaction manifest in the rest of the world?\n\nMore specifically:\n
 \n- How do gender\, sexuality\, discourse\, and language intersect with ra
 pid change?\n- How are transitions\, discourse\, language\, gender\, and s
 exuality mutually constitutive?\n- How are meanings discursively construct
 ed across various timescales in relation to gender and sexuality? \n- How 
 do short-term gender performances persist across time as we interact in th
 e present? \n- How do we project our gendered and sexualized ‘selves’ 
 and societies into the future while drawing on the past?\n\nThe conference
  will aim to provide a platform for researchers and research students from
  around the world to discuss these themes of timescale and change via nume
 rous sub-themes\, including the following examples:\n\n(this list is in ra
 ndom order and not exhaustive)\n\n- Timescales\, identity\, and gender/sex
 uality\n- Transitions: gendered and sexualized selves\, bodies and societi
 es\n- Rapid change\, compressed modernity\, and gender/sexuality\n- Democr
 atic movements and gender/sexuality\n- Economic systems and gender/sexuali
 ty in Asia (and beyond)\n- Political authority and gender/sexuality in Asi
 a (and beyond)\n- Southeast Asian communities and gender/sexuality\n- Chin

 ble.limsi.fr/bucc2016/\n\nMonday\, May 23\, 2016\n\nCo-located with LREC 2
 016\, Portorož\, Slovenia\n  \nMotivation:\n\nIn the language engineering
  and the linguistics communities\, research on comparable corpora has been
  motivated by two main reasons. In\nlanguage engineering\, on the one hand
 \, it is chiefly motivated by the need to use comparable corpora as traini
 ng data for statistical Natural Language Processing applications such as s
 tatistical machine translation or cross-lingual retrieval. In linguistics\
 , on the other hand\, comparable corpora are of interest in themselves by 
 making possible inter-linguistic discoveries and comparisons. It is genera
 lly accepted in both communities that comparable corpora are documents in 
 one or several languages that are comparable in content and form in variou
 s degrees and dimensions. We believe that the linguistic definitions and o
 bservations related to comparable corpora can improve methods to mine such
  corpora for applications of statistical NLP. As such\, it is of great int
 erest to bring together builders and users of such corpora.\n\nShared Task
 :\n\nThere will be a shared task on ''Identifying Parallel Sentences in Co
 mparable Corpora'' whose details will be described on the workshop website
  (URL see above).\n\nOrganisers: \n\nReinhard Rapp\, University of Mainz (

DESCRIPTION:As Europe is currently facing the worst displacement crisis si
 nce the Second World War\, the dominant public discourse on the issue is c
 haracterized by a curious mixture of xenophobia and humanitarianism. What 
 is forgotten in this debate is that\, historically speaking\, Europe has a
 lways been a place of migrations. After all\, the rough outlines of today'
 s national composition of the continent is to a very great extent the resu
 lt of the Great Migration (4–8 century AD). The people who came to Europ
 e at that time met populations\, like the Greeks and the Romans\, who were
  themselves the children of earlier migrants. It is impossible to list her
 e all the waves of migrations throughout European history\, but some of th
 e very many movements of populations that have created today's picture of 
 Europe are: The expansion of Greeks to South Italy and Asia Minor in Antiq
 uity\; the expulsions of Jews from England\, France\, Spain in the Middle 
 Ages\; the immigration of the Huguenots in the seventeenth century\; the R
 ussian White émigrés after the Russian Revolution\; the exiles from the 
 dictatorships in Southern Europe in the middle twentieth century\;  while\
 , only fifteen years ago\, the Yugoslav Wars and the accompanying ethnic c
 leansing by all sides involved had not yet been completed.\n\nWe would lik
 e to invite to the Seventh Symposium on European Languages in East Asia co
 ntributions that deal with how the changes brought by (past or current) mo
 vements of populations reflect upon\, and are reflected by\, European lang
 uages in all their manifestations: linguistic system and language use\, li
 terature and popular discourse\, language policy and language education.

SUMMARY:Revisiting the Communicative Approach in English Language Teaching

DESCRIPTION:Communicative language teaching or the communicative approach 
 has been celebrated as the ultimate solution to language teaching in the f
 ace of increasing dissatisfaction with the structuralist approaches to lan
 guage studies and audiolingualism.  The communicative approach emphasizes 
 communication and meaning in language teaching and promises rapid results 
 in language learning. The method was hailed in the Arab world and hurriedl
 y adopted by institutions aiming at offering high quality education. Howev
 er\, recent studies are starting to question the ability of the communicat
 ive approach to deliver comprehensive solutions to English language teachi
 ng\, specifically in non-native contexts. The conference is aimed at quest
 ioning some of the exiting principles of the communicative approach throug
 h presenting case studies that recount applications of the communicative a
 pproach in non-native English language teaching contexts. The overall aim 
 is to revisit the communicative approach and identify the major components
  that need to be incorporated in the communicative approach to support tea
 ching and learning of English in non-native contexts. Specifically\, prese
 ntations need to reflect on whether or not a communicative approach should
  focus on receptive skills before productive ones or oral before written\;
  whether or not grammatical competence should be an essential component of
  communicative competence\; whether a functionally-based communicative app
 roach is more likely to have positive consequences for second language lea
 rners\; and whether or not non-native texts should be incorporated into se
 cond language classroom material.

SUMMARY:LREC 2016 Workshop: Translation Evaluation
DTSTART;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20160524T000000

DESCRIPTION:Current MT/HT evaluation approaches\, both automatic and manua
 l\, are characterised by a high degree of fragmentation\, heterogeneity an
 d a lack of interoperability between tools and data sets. As a consequence
 \, it is difficult to reproduce\, interpret\, and compare evaluation resul
 ts. The main objective of this workshop is to bring together researchers w
 orking on MT and HT evaluation\, including providers and users of tools or
  evaluation approaches (including metrics and methodologies) as well as pr
 actitioners (translators\, users of MT\, LSPs etc.).\n\nThis workshop take
 s an in-depth look at an area of ever-increasing importance: approaches\, 
 tools and data support for the evaluation of human translation (HT) and ma
 chine translation (MT)\, with a focus on MT. Two clear trends have emerged
  over the past several years. The first trend involves standardising evalu
 ations in research through large shared tasks in which actual translations
  are compared to reference translations using automatic metrics and/or hum
 an ranking. The second trend focuses on achieving high quality translation
 s with the help of increasingly complex data sets that contain many levels
  of annotation based on sophisticated quality metrics – often organised 
 in the context of smaller shared tasks. In industry\, we also observe an i
 ncreased interest in workflows for high quality outbound translation that 
 combine Translation Memory (TM)/Machine Translation and post-editing. In s
 tark contrast to this trend to quality translation (QT) and its inherent o
 verall approach and complexity\, the data and tooling landscapes remain ra
 ther heterogeneous\, uncoordinated and not interoperable. \n\nThe event wi
 ll bring together MT and HT researchers\, users and providers of tools\, a
 nd users and providers of manual and automatic evaluation methodologies cu
 rrently used for the purpose of evaluating HT and MT systems. The key obje
 ctive of the workshop is to initiate a dialogue and discuss whether the cu
 rrent approach involving a diverse and heterogeneous set of data\, tools a
 nd evaluation methodologies is appropriate enough or if the community shou
 ld\, instead\, collaborate towards building an integrated ecosystem that p
 rovides better and more sustainable access to data sets\, evaluation workf
 lows\, approaches and metrics and supporting processes such as annotation\
 , ranking and so on. \n\nThe workshop is meant to stimulate a dialogue abo
 ut the commonalities\, similarities and differences of the existing soluti
 ons in the three areas (1) tools\, (2) methodologies\, (3) data sets. A ke
 y question concerns the high level of flexibility and lack of interoperabi
 lity of heterogeneous approaches\, while a homogeneous approach would prov
 ide less flexibility but higher interoperability. How much flexibility and
  interoperability does the MT/HT research community need? How much does it
  want?

DESCRIPTION:The Association for French Language Studies conference 2016 wi
 ll take place from 20-22 June 2016 at Queen’s University Belfast\, UK. \
 n\nThe conference theme for AFLS 2016 addresses the concept of French as a
  shared language. In a period of significant population movement\, it is t
 imely to focus on the impact of mobility\, migration and contact\, both sy
 nchronically and diachronically. This impact is felt in a number of ways\,
  not least on the evolution of the language itself (its lexis\, syntax\, m
 orphology and phonology)\, on its usage in a variety of domains\, on the i
 dentities of its speakers and on their attitudes towards the French langua
 ge. Within francophone contexts\, rural depopulation and the growth of sup
 er- diverse urban communities are also playing a role in shaping the Frenc
 h language\, for example\, in the form of supra-regional or new urban vari
 eties. At the same time\, there is an acknowledged ‘crisis’ in the lev
 els of foreign language competency in the UK and Ireland\, with serious im
 plications for approaches to pedagogy: French is struggling to retain its 
 position as a major ‘shared international language’ but fluency in Fre
 nch is top of the Confederation of British Industry’s list of employers
 ’ desired linguistic skills.\n\nConfirmed plenaries/Conférences pléni

 This year the conference will focus around the theme of ''challenging assu
 mptions'' in English language teaching.\n\nexcitELT will be a fast-paced f
 low of relevant speeches\, workshops\, networking\, and discussion panels.
  We believe plenaries should be short and engaging\; workshops\, interacti

 o see some of our profession's greatest practitioners showing off their fa
 vourite techniques. \n\nWe also recognise that lots of the best things abo
 ut conferences take place in the gaps in the conference schedule. We will 
 be maximising opportunities for attendees to meet\, collaborate and learn 
 from each other. We'll have a lounge and special activities lined up for t
 hose who want to meet and learn from their fellow teachers. \n\nThe confer

 \n\nThe aim of the conference is to examine how linguistic ethnography can
  be used in order to capture cultural\, gendered\, linguistic and other ki
 nds of diversity in today's global societies. In line with Södertörn Uni
 versity's intercultural profile\, conference papers will explore the role 
 of language in diverse settings: in the workplace\, in education\, in the 
 community and at home. Today\, with the development of technology\, inform
 ation and capital are transcending social and geographical barriers thus g
 iving new forms to communication. The challenges of conducting ethnography
  in order to capture these new globalized yet diverse settings are larger 
 than ever and in this conference we wish to explore new theories and metho
 ds and discuss research results from studies that have set out to achieve 
 this.\n\nThe following plenary speakers have confirmed their participation

DESCRIPTION:This seminar explores cases of change from above in the histor
 y of English. Change from above refers to the consciousness dimension of l
 inguistic change\, to changes that come from above the level of a speaker
 ’s conscious awareness (cf. Labov 1965\, 1994). It concerns cases of bor
 rowings from languages which the dominant classes consider prestigious\, o
 r conscious selection\, such as the retention and the re-introduction of a
 ffirmative do in seventeenth century documents (cf.\, for instance\, Rissa
 nen 1991) or the diachrony of negative concord (among others\, Nevalainen 
 2006). The seminar will discuss\, among other issues\, the (re)introductio
 n of elements by the dominant social class in various stages of the histor
 y of English\, their correlation with changes in other features\, their (n
 on)integration into the vernacular system\, formal vs. functional approach
 es to change from above and the question of the coexistent systems.\n\nRef

DESCRIPTION:The DSALT workshop seeks to foster discussion at the intersect
 ion of distributional semantics and various subfields of theoretical lingu
 istics\, with the goal of boosting the impact of distributional semantics 
 on linguistic research beyond lexical semantic phenomena\, as well as broa
 dening the empirical basis and theoretical tools used in linguistics. We w
 elcome contributions regarding the theoretical interpretation  of distribu
 tional vector spaces and/or their application to theoretical morphology\, 
 syntax\, semantics\, discourse\, dialogue\, and any other subfield of ling
 uistics. Potential topics of interest include\, among others:\n\n* Distrib
 utional semantics and morphology: How do results in the distributional sem
 antics-morphology interface impact theoretical accounts of morphology? Can
  distributional models account for inflectional morphology? Can they shed 
 light on phenomena like productivity and regularity?\n\n* Distributional s
 emantics and syntax: How can compositionality at the semantic level intera
 ct with syntactic structure? Can we go beyond the state of the art in acco
 unting for the syntax-semantics interface when it interacts with lexical s
 emantics? How can distributional accounts for gradable syntactic phenomena
 \, e.g. selectional preferences or argument alternations\, be integrated i
 nto theoretical linguistic accounts?\n\n* Distributional semantics and for
 mal semantics: How can distributional representations be related to the tr
 aditional components of a semantics for natural languages\, especially ref
 erence and truth? Can distributional models be integrated with discourse- 
 or dialogue-oriented semantic theories like file change semantics or inqui
 sitive semantics?\n\n* Distributional semantics and discourse: Distributio
 nal semantics has shown to be able to model some aspects of discourse cohe
 rence at a global level (Landauer and Dumais 1997\, a.o.)\; can it also he
 lp with other discourse-related phenomena\, such as the choice of discours
 e particles\, nominal and verbal anaphora\, or the form of referring expre
 ssions as discourse unfolds? \n\n* Distributional semantics and dialogue: 
 Distributional semantics has traditionally been mostly static\, in the sen
 se that it creates a semantic representation for a word once and for all. 
 Can it be made dynamic so it can help model\, for example\, phenomena rela
 ted to Questions Under Discussion (QUDs) in dialogue? Can distributional r
 epresentations help predict the relations between utterance units in dialo
 gue?\n\n* Distributional semantics and pragmatics: Distributional semantic
 s is based on the statistics of language use\, and therefore should includ
 e information related to pragmatics of language. How do distributional mod
 els relate to such aspects of pragmatics as focus\, pragmatic presuppositi
 on\, or conversational implicature?\n\nInvited Speakers:\n\nMarco Baroni (

DESCRIPTION:This workshop is concerned with modeling discontinuous structu
 res across different disciplines in NLP.­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­
 ­­­­­­­­ The modeling of certain structures in natural language re
 quires a mechanism for discontinuity\,in the sense that we must account fo
 r two or more parts of the structure that are not adjacent. This is true a
 cross many languages and on different description levels. For instance\, o
 n the lexical level\, this concerns discontinuous morphological phenomena 
 such as transfixation (templatic morphology)\, as well as phrasal verbs\, 
 and non­contiguous multiword expressions. \n\nOn the syntactic level\, di
 scontinuity is caused by phenomena such as extraposition and topicalizatio
 n\, or argument scrambling. Morphologically rich languages (MRLs) are part
 icularly likely to exhibit such phenomena. Other examples include disfluen
 cy and anaphora/coreference resolution with discontinuous antecedents\; mo
 deling in both of the latter areas requires an extended domain of locality
 . On a higher level\, discontinuity is a relevant factor in machine transl
 ation\, as well as in complex question answering and in topic structure mo
 deling. \n\nDiscontinuity has been studied intensively in a range of diffe
 rent areas\, including but not limited to grammar development\, syntactic 
 and semantic parsing\, morphological analysis\, machine translation\, anap
 hora resolution\, discourse modeling\, automatic summarization and complex
  question answering. This workshop is intended to bring people from such f
 ields together.\n\nProgram Committee:\n\n­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­

DESCRIPTION:We are excited to announce the 10th Linguistics Conference on 
 22 April 2016. Undergraduate\, graduate and postgraduate students are very
  welcome to present their original research (e.g. for (a part of) a thesis
  or on a project) in a friendly atmosphere with fellow students\, research
 ers and lecturers. \n\nT.W.I.S.T.\, the Leiden student association for lin
 guistics\, has organized the students’ conference for the past nine year
 s. This edition will be extra interesting as we are celebrating the 10th a
 nniversary. It will be a notable event that everyone who is interested in 
 linguistics will surely want to experience.\n\nResearch on all languages a
 nd all areas of linguistics are welcomed: from descriptive linguistics to 
 syntax and from sociolinguistics to historical phonology. All presentation
 s have a duration of 20 minutes and there will be ﬁve minutes time for d
 iscussion. Some topics from past conferences are: “Nominal tense: how Am
 azonian languages punch us in the face”\, “The paradoxal combination o
 f ‘yes no’ in spoken Dutch”\, “Word learning strategies in SLI tee
 nagers” and “Gallo-Romance in the Lex Salica”. \n\nWhat we offer:\n\
 nThe T.W.I.S.T. students’ conference offers you a truly academic yet ope
 n and informal platform to present your research to fellow students and fe
 llow researchers from all over the country. As a speaker you are naturally
  invited to attend lectures by guest speakers\, students and postgraduates
 .\nA lunch is provided.\n\nThe best papers will be selected for publicatio
 n in the proceedings of the conference.\nIn between lectures and during th
 e breaks you will have plenty of opportunities to meet and converse with f
 ellow students\, researchers and academic lecturers. The conferences have 
 been attended by over 70 students and researchers.

DESCRIPTION:The study of subordination raised the interest of researchers 
 in several disciplines of linguistics. Within the typological and function
 alist framework\, Cristofaro (2003) and Dixon & Aikhenvald (2006) illustra
 te the various strategies of subordination and complementation. In formal 
 linguistics\, Adger (2013) and Cecchetto and Donati (2015) focussed on the
  contrast between the structural notion of complement and adjunct within t
 he domain of clausal modification in the DP. In historical linguistics\, K
 iparsky (1995) argues that proto-indoeuropean does not have sentential emb
 edding\, while Davison (2009) claims that Sanskrit does not have subordina
 tion. In sign language\, complement clauses do not appear in argument posi
 tion (Geraci\, Cecchetto & Zucchi 2008\, Geraci & Aristodemo\, in press). 
 More generally\, in these languages the absence of manual signs marking sy
 ntactic subordination and the difficulty of a clear categorization of the 
 non-manual components make particularly hard the identification of specifi
 c subordination markers (Pfau & Steinbach in press). Finally\, recent cont
 roversial findings in Amazonian languages like Pirahã raised the issue of
  whether genuine subordination is present in those languages (Everett 2005
  and Nevins\, Pesetsky & Rodrigues 2009).

SUMMARY:Forms of Multilingualism in Secondary and Tertiary Education

DESCRIPTION:The conference deals with the use\, function and perception of
  languages and varieties in secondary and tertiary education. Against the 
 background of an integrative notion of internal and external multilinguali
 sm and an enhanced dialogue between researchers of different directions\, 
 focus will be on language use\, language attitudes\, language and educatio
 n policy framework\, as well as new linguistic concepts to an integrative 
 treatment of different forms of multilingualism.\n\nDue to migration proce
 sses\, (educational) mobility\, and globalisation\, multilingualism plays 
 an important role in society. General awareness of multilingualism is high
  – both in terms of different varieties of the same language (so-called 
 “internal multilingualism”) as well as with regard to different langua
 ges (“external multilingualism”). On the whole\, assessment of multili
 ngualism is often very positive (multilingualism as an ''opportunity''\, a
 s a value in itself). For particular cases\, however\, the spectrum of att
 itudes is broad\, and the various forms of internal and external multiling
 ualism receive rather mixed assessments or are judged predominantly negati
 vely (denigration of many languages and varieties\, multilingualism as a '
 'cost factor'').  This ambivalence also becomes apparent in the educationa
 l institutions in which the aforementioned forms of multilingualism inhere
 ntly play an important role: Local varieties\, although occurring in many 
 communication situations\, are either not named at all or are only referre
 d to as a linguistic behaviour that must be avoided. Certain (foreign) lan
 guages – increasingly as working languages – are  promoted with a larg
 e investment of time and money and contribute to greater prestige for scho
 ols\, for example. In contrast\, most of the heritage languages of pupils\
 , students\, or teachers are still considered an obstacle or are simply ig
 nored\, both in the everyday life of the institution and during the learni
 ng process.\n\nAlthough these types of multilingualism are closely intertw
 ined in everyday life\, they are mostly dealt with in different research t
 raditions.

SUMMARY:New Approaches to Corpus in English Linguistics
DTSTART;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20160609T000000

DESCRIPTION:It is historically the case that linguists interested in pragm
 atic phenomena -- whether in terms of speech act theory\, relevance theory
 \, argumentation\, enunciation\, etc. -- have not always made use of corpo
 ra or\, when they have done so\, have used them in a spirit of ''illustrat
 ive eclecticism'' (Kohnen 2015:56)\, drawing on genuine examples to illust
 rate a theoretical perspective. In recent years various semasiological app
 roaches have considered how the apparent polysemies of a given marker can 
 be fruitfully explained in terms of complex configurations\, as the postul
 ated semantic potentials of cooccurring items interact to generate context
 ually situated values. Such an approach opens new perspectives for quantit
 ative exploitation of corpus material in theories which have traditionally
  stressed qualitative analysis of a limited number of cases. The technolog
 y of corpus enquiry now enables us to conduct sophisticated searches in te
 rms of collocational affinities\, bearing on data which can -- according t
 o how the corpus is tagged and marked up -- involve linguistic and paralin
 guistic features both (pauses\, overlaps\, speakers' identities\, textual 
 genres etc.).\n\nThe aim of the present conference is therefore to investi
 gate the usefulness and relevance of the quantitative analysis of corpus d
 ata of English and Englishes\, in those areas of linguistic research where
  a more qualitative\, fine-grained approach has traditionally prevailed. I
 ssues addressed might include:\n\n- Semantico-pragmatic profiling of speci
 fic markers or configurations of markers via quantitative corpus-based dat
 a\n- Preprocessing requirements on corpora with a view to such research\, 
 i.e. specific or ad hoc tagging or mark up conventions\n- Types of corpus 
 enquiry\, tools\, syntax and/or algorithms relevant to such research\n\nIn
  keeping with the programme of our local research group Identité Culturel
 le\, Textes et Théâtralité\, studies that address issues of corpus appr
 oaches to linguistic identities are also encouraged.\n\nWe will be pleased
  and honoured to welcome as our guest speakers Professors Lucie Gournay an
 d Sebastian Hoffmann.\n\nLucie Gournay is Professor of Linguistics and dir
 ector of a research group on linguistics and language-teaching didactics\,
  within the laboratory EA IMAGER\, at the University Paris-Est Créteil. S
 he practises an enunciative approach to linguistics\, oriented in particul
 ar towards contrastive questions. Professor Gournay will be considering co
 rpus-building issues in the study of complex syntactic constructions.\n\nS
 ebastian Hoffmann is Professor of English Linguistics at Trier University.
  His research predominantly focuses on the application of usage-based appr
 oaches to the study of language.He is a co-author of BNCweb\, a user-frien
 dly web-interface to the British National Corpus\, which also forms the ba
 sis for his textbook publication /Corpus Linguistics with BNCweb – a Pra
 ctical Guide /(Peter Lang\, 2008\; with S. Evert\, N. Smith\, D. Lee and Y
 . Berglund-Prytz).\n\nSupported by ICTT EA 4277 http://ictt.univ-avignon.f
