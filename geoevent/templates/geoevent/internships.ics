SUMMARY:Second Annual Grammar Bootcamp: Yale University

DESCRIPTION:I will be holding a summer 'grammar boot camp' from July 5 to 
 July 29\, 2016. The idea is to have up to four advanced undergraduate stud
 ents work intensively on existing high-quality archival field notes and re
 cordings with the aim of producing a publishable sketch grammar. Students 
 will receive a stipend and travel expenses to come to Yale. This follows f
 rom a very successful first bootcamp in 2015.\n\nThe materials to be worke
 d on will be from an Australian Aboriginal language from Western Australia
  and will include both print materials and audio files. It is probable tha
 t the 'print' materials will already be digitized and in Toolbox.\n\nStude
 nts will meet once a day as a group with me to discuss analyses and writin
 g. They will spend the rest of the time working with the materials in the 
 Linguistics department. They will receive regular detailed feedback on the
  analysis and writing. Familiarity with Australian languages is not requir
 ed but I would expect that successful applicants would do some reading of 
 grammars of related languages prior to the start of the boot camp. \n\nApp
 lications for the boot camp are now open. The deadline for applications is
  January 22\, 2016\, and applicants will be notified of the result in mid-
 February. \n\nTo apply\, please send the following materials electronicall
 y:\n\n- a letter of application\, describing your experience in linguistic
 s\, including research experience\, your future plans\, and why you'd like
  to join the boot camp. \n- a writing sample\, such as a linguistics term 
 paper\n- course transcript (this can be an unofficial transcript)\n\nPleas
 e send materials as file attachments to bootcamp@pamanyungan.net\, cc'ed t
 o claire.bowern@yale.edu. Applications will be acknowledged within 2 days 
 - if you don't get an acknowledgment\, please let me know.\n\nPlease also 
 arrange for one or two letters of recommendation/support from faculty to b
 e sent to the same email addresses\, also by January 22.\n\nStudents will 
 need to show some evidence of prior research experience (e.g. through an R
 A-ship or by having a senior thesis in progress) and some familiarity with
  language documentation procedures (e.g. through having taken a field meth
 ods class or equivalent\, such as having attended CoLang or a LSA Institut
 e class). Applicants will need to show attention to detail and ability to 
 focus on a project for a sustained period. Students will need to be able t
 o travel to New Haven for the entire period of the boot camp and should ex
 pect to work solely on this project during that time\, including some even
 ings and weekends.
