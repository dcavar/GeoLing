DESCRIPTION:The Escuela de Lingüística de Buenos Aires (ELBA) is a schoo
 l aimed to foster the training of developing researchers in the field of l
 inguistics by offering courses delivered both by international and local i
 nstructors. Our goal is threefold. We hope to encourage new researchers\, 
 to tight the bond between local and international linguists\, and also to 
 give students the opportunity to take part in ongoing debates in the field
  by allowing them the chance to discuss with the specialists themselves.\n
 \nIn its first edition\, there will be four week-long courses and a worksh
 op. The courses will be the following:\n\n- “Lectures on agreement”\, 
 by Hedde Zeiljstra (Georg-August Universität Göttingen)\n- “Is literal
  language easier to understand? An introduction to non-literal language pr
 ocessing”\, by Mercedes Marcilese (Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora)
 .\n- “Current Issues in Sign Languages Linguistics”\, by Josep Quer (I
 CREA & Universitat Pompeu Fabra).\n- “The semantics of modality\, eviden
 tiality and mirativity”\, by Andrés Salanova (Université d’Ottawa).\
 n\nThe Workshop will take place on February 20\, 2016\, just a day after t
 he end of the courses. The proposals should be sent as an attached documen
 t to elbalinguistics@gmail.com before December 15th\, 2015. Abstract shoul
 d be anonymous and not longer than two pages\, including references and ex
 amples\, with margins of at least 1-inch\, 12pt Times New Roman. The name 
 of the authors and their institutional affiliation must be included in the
  plain text part of the e-mail. Only one submission will be accepted per a
 uthor. Participants will be informed if their presentations have been acce
 pted by December 23. Each presentation will last twenty minutes\, and it w
 ill be followed by ten additional minutes for discussion. No parallel sess
 ions will be held. \n\nThe official languages are Spanish\, English and Po
 rtuguese\, but we strongly suggest preparing handouts/slides in English.

DESCRIPTION:A non-exclusive list of topics to be covered includes:\n\n- Wh
 at can one expect from software in discourse studies? Wherein lies the add
 ed value\, if any? And how does one realize this value to the fullest?\n- 
 What kind of theoretical\, heuristic and methodological issues need to be 
 addressed when using software in discourse studies? \n- How can one use so
 ftware tools in order to investigate the dispersion and functioning of dis
 cursive and ideological processes such as argumentation\, identification\,
  interpellation\, hegemonization and so on?\n- To what extent can we go be
 yond ‘mere coding’ and ‘counting’ when using quantitative\, qualit
 ative or mixed-methods software packages?How can we use software tools to 
 explore the various linguistic\, multimodal and knowledge-related dimensio
 ns of discourse?\n- How and when does one decide about whether to use soft
 ware in discourse studies? And if so\, what (kind of) package should one u
 se? How can we use software in order to identify\, explore and/or rearticu
 late ideologies\, hegemonies and other large-scale discursive patterns in 
 data?\n- Does the usage of software provide an added value in our search f
 or implicit meanings in linguistic and multimodal forms of discourse?\n- H
 ow can software be used in order to visualize quantitative and/or qualitat
 ive patterns in discourse? \n \nWe provide an introduction into key theore
 tical\, heuristic and practical issues regarding research design in comput
 er-assisted discourse analysis. We offer three interactional workshops foc
 using on the use of quantitative\, qualitative and mixed-methods software 
 in discourse studies. After each workshop\, participants will present ongo
 ing research projects so they can receive feedback from fellow researchers
 . \n \nCandidates may work with data as varied as interview transcripts\, 
 focus groups\, ethnographic observations\, multimodal and/or mediatized da
 ta from quantitative and qualitative perspectives. We aim for a diverse gr
 oup of participants working with a variety of perspectives ranging from in
 teractional and pragmatic approaches to discourse to the more abstract pos
 tstructuralist discourse theories\, and anything in between and beyond. \n
  \nThe deadline for application is October 31. Students may expect a decis
 ion on their application on November 15th. The spring school itself takes 
 place from March 21 to March 24. \n \nNote that prior to this Spring Schoo
 l\, the 17th DiscourseNet conference on Reflexivity and Critique in Discou
 rse will also take place at UNAV from March 16 to March 18. This conferenc

DESCRIPTION:Renowned researchers from Germany\, Europe and the United Stat

 ition\, and Variation.\n\nThe courses in the thematic area Theory (A1-A6) 
 focus on the formal modeling of natural language meaning and its theoretic
 al foundations. The following courses will be offered:\n\nA1 (Gottfried Vo
 sgerau) The metaphysics of meaning \nA2 (Nicholas Asher) Formal and distri
 butional lexical semantics\nA3 (Sebastian Löbner) Frame theory and semant
 ics\nA4 (Daniel Altshuler) Temporal interpretation of narrative discourse:
  Exploring the interaction between prominence and coherence\nA5 (Katharina
  Hartmann) Information structure: Intonation and meaning\nA6 (Jana Bressem
  & Ellen Fricke) Gesture\, grammar and cognition: a multimodal approach to
  language use\n\nThe courses in the thematic area Cognition (B1-B6) focus 
 on the acquisition and the processing of natural language meaning. The fol
 lowing courses will be offered:\n\nB1 (Petra Schulz) Acquisition of semant
 ics\nB2 (Berry Claus) Concepts and word meanings: Representational and pro
 cessing issues \nB3 (Michael Wagner) Prosody and incremental processing \n
 B4 (Lyn Frazier) Processing at the syntax-discourse interface \nB5 (Oliver
  Bott) Psycholinguistic work on coercion: Resolving compositional conflict
 s during online comprehension \nB6 (Barbara Dancygier) Cognitive poetics: 
 Exploring literary nuts and bolts through linguistic analysis\n\nThe topic
  of the courses in the area Variation (C1-C6) is the wealth of variation o
 f natural language meaning\, as it arises based on diverse historical\, la
 nguage-specific\, social\, and medial conditions. The following courses wi
 ll be offered:\n\nC1 (Remus Gergel) Anything goes in semantic change? Usin
 g data\, compositionality and the interfaces towards a restrictive theory 
 \nC2 (Thomas Jügel) Perfect mapping: Typological similarities and variati
 ons of the perfect across languages \nC3 (Gemma Barberà) The meaning of s
 pace in sign language: Conveying reference in a different language modalit
 y \nC4 (Sally McConnell-Ginet) Meaning\, society\, and power \nC5 (Cedric 
 Boeckx) The descent of meaning: Primate semantics\, with Modification \nC6
  (Christina Unger) Computational approaches to meaning\n\nFor further info

DTSTART;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20160613T000000
DTEND;TZID=US/Eastern;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20160624T000000

DESCRIPTION:The first Summer School in Languages and Linguistics of the Me
 diterranean will be held in Cagliari (Italy) from 13 to 24 June 2016. Para
 phrasing what has been said for other disciplines\, there are plenty of im
 portant studies on languages ​​in the Mediterranean\, but there are ve
 ry few\, or indeed none\, which are actually about Mediterranean languages
 . The LLM School aims to fill the need to use an empirical approach to exa
 mine the product of thousands of years of language contact in this unique 
 geo-anthropic context and to analyse these results from a 'holistic' but a
 nti-essentialist perspective which does not adhere to any preconstituted t
 heory.\n\nWithin this framework\, the Language Description courses are of 
 great importance. Particular attention will be paid to non-standard dialec
 ts and varieties in general for two main reasons: firstly because they are
  generally less well known\, but also due to the fact that they represent 
 a fuller and more nuanced phenomenology of language contact\, which has no
 t been affected (or is less affected) by the language policies of the esta
 blished state-communities.\n\nThe linguistics courses offer a comprehensiv
 e overview of studies on the languages ​​of the Mediterranean. Various
  theoretical approaches will be proposed to deal with the problems of lang
 uage contact\, especially in the historical and diachronic dimension. Inde
 ed\, partly because the spread of writing in the Mediterranean region date
 s back to extremely ancient times\, the region offers an extremely rich an
 d extensive linguistic tradition\, which is both long-lasting and genetica
 lly differentiated. Therefore\, the Mediterranean is a privileged observat
 ory for historical-diachronic studies of relatively long periods. On this 
 occasion\, the focus will be placed on the Latin Romance linguistic tradit
 ion.
